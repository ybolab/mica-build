# THE BOARD'S OWN DELTAS over the committed vendor config. The three groups are
# the vendor Wi-Fi stack turned off (this board's radio is the AIC8800 and the
# Broadcom/Rockchip drivers fight it for the SDIO slot), the small board devices
# turned on, and the firmware path the AIC driver looks in.
#
# LOCALVERSION_AUTO is disabled for reproducibility: it appends the git
# description of the SOURCE TREE to the kernel release, and the tree here is a
# detached FETCH_HEAD with a patch series applied and not committed, so it would
# stamp "-dirty" and a hash into every module path.
#
# THE BOOT LOGO is the fourth group, and it is a board decision rather than a
# shared one: this board has an HDMI output that shows a login prompt otherwise,
# and PLAN-088 turns that into a logo. CLUT224 is the only variant kept --
# fb_find_logo picks by colour depth and this board's fbdev is never below 8
# bits, so LOGO_LINUX_MONO and LOGO_LINUX_VGA16 (both `default y` under LOGO)
# would compile two bitmaps nothing can select.

# THE BOARD'S OWN OPTIONS, AND NOTHING ELSE. This loop used to restate 19
# symbols that boards/common/mos-required.fragment now pins -- BRIDGE, VETH, the
# NF_TABLES and NFT_* core, CGROUP_BPF and the NFT_FIB family -- and the fragment
# loop below asserts every one of them against the same built .config, on both
# boards. Two lists free to disagree are one list that is not enforced, so the
# duplicates are gone and what is left is what no shared floor could state:
#
#   * this hardware -- an RK3576 with a USB gadget controller and a gadget serial
#     console, and eMMC/USB storage. A QEMU machine has none of it.
#   * the arm64 accelerated AES. The shared floor carries the generic xts(aes)
#     the crypt target resolves through and says why that is capability rather
#     than a feature; CE_BLK is this architecture's fast path for it and exists
#     on no other, which is why the floor cannot name it. x64 carries
#     CRYPTO_AES_NI_INTEL for the same reason.
#
# THE FIREWALL REMAINDER IS GONE FROM HERE TOO, and it left by two different
# routes (RFCT-304). The seven xt matches and targets moved into the shared
# fragment, because the measurement made them an engine-and-tooling fact rather
# than policy: the shipped iptables stores every extension as an nft_compat `xt`
# expression, and on a kernel without the module the rule is refused outright.
# They were =y here and absent or =m on x64, which is why `iptables -j REDIRECT`
# worked on this board and not on that one. The ten legacy IP_NF_*/IP6_NF_*
# entries are simply gone: iptables-nft builds its raw and nat tables in
# nf_tables and needs none of them -- measured, on a kernel with IP_NF_RAW unset,
# `iptables -t raw -A PREROUTING -j ACCEPT` succeeds and stores a native rule --
# and the only front-end that does need them is iptables-legacy, which nothing in
# this tree selects. Asserting them here made this board's legacy surface look
# like a requirement when it is a leftover of the vendor config.
#
# tests/netavark-kernel-config-test.sh READS THIS LOOP by name (`for option in`
# through `; do`) and requires every symbol netavark programs a rule against to
# be gated either here or by the shared fragment. It followed this loop out of
# the Dockerfile into this file under RFCT-345; the loop's shape is the contract.
