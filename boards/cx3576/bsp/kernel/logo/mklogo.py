# mos-build-side: container -- kernel/Dockerfile runs this in the BSP builder
# against the committed master, and writes the result over the vendor tree's
# logo_linux_clut224.ppm. Nothing in this repository's checkout is touched.
#
# Convert the board splash master to the ASCII PPM the kernel's own
# drivers/video/logo/pnmtologo.c compiles into logo_linux_clut224.o.
#
#   mklogo.py <master.png> <out.ppm> <width> <height>
#
# THE MASTER IS THE ONLY SOURCE. The PPM is derived here at build time rather
# than committed beside the PNG: a generated file in the tree is a second copy
# of the artwork that nothing forces to agree with the first, and the two would
# drift the moment someone edited one of them. Deriving it means the question
# "does the PPM match the master" cannot be asked, because there is only ever
# one answer in the tree.
#
# EVERY STEP IS INTEGER AND ORDER-INDEPENDENT, because this runs inside the
# reproducibility boundary kernel/Dockerfile's four pins establish: the resample
# is exact rational area-averaging, the quantiser is a median cut whose splits
# are decided by counts and channel extents alone, and the palette is emitted in
# sorted order. Two runs on one input produce one byte string; floating point
# would make that a property of the libm build instead.
#
# pnmtologo.c's constraints, which this file exists to satisfy:
#   * MAX_LINUX_LOGO_COLORS is 224 (pnmtologo.c:43). 225 distinct colours is a
#     hard error at kernel build time, not a degraded logo.
#   * `P3` (ASCII RGB) with a maxval, read by get_number255 (pnmtologo.c:119).
#
# fbmem.c's constraints, which decide <width> and <height>:
#   * fb_prepare_logo drops the logo entirely when its HEIGHT exceeds the mode's
#     yres (fbmem.c:650-653), and fb_show_logo_line reduces the copy count to
#     zero when its WIDTH does not fit xres (fbmem.c:513). Both failures are a
#     blank screen, not a crash -- so the geometry is chosen to fit the smallest
#     mode this product's HDMI is expected to negotiate, not the largest.
