const USAGE = `usage: bash build/run.sh --compare-roots [--sanctions FILE] DIR_A DIR_B
       bash build/run.sh --compare-roots --extract-oci ARCHIVE DIR

Compares two ALREADY-EXTRACTED root trees and reports the difference set,
classified against a written sanction ledger. This is the instrument behind
PLAN-036 section 6's last paragraph: x64 built through both the rootfs stage
chain and the package composer, their unpacked trees compared, every difference
either sanctioned in writing or reported.

  DIR_A            the baseline root -- the path being replaced (the stage chain)
  DIR_B            the candidate root -- the path replacing it (the composer)
  --sanctions FILE the ledger (default: tests/dual-build-sanctions.md)

PASS ABSOLUTE PATHS. run.sh runs bun with build/ as its working directory,
so a relative argument is resolved against build/ and not against wherever
the caller stood -- which surfaces as "does not exist" naming a path the caller
can see. Every mode of run.sh behaves this way; this is the one that takes bare
directories rather than a --out-dir with an absolute default.

'added' means present in B and absent in A, so which argument is which decides
what the ledger's stanzas mean. PLAN-036 sanctions ADDITIONS -- package
documentation and the package composition record -- so the composed root is B.

Compared, for every path in the union of the two trees: presence, file type,
mode, uid, gid, symlink target, regular-file content hash, and file
capabilities. NOT mtime -- src/compare-roots.ts says why at the site.

  --extract-oci ARCHIVE DIR
                   unpack a factory-root.oci (the OCI-layout tar that
                   rootfs/compose/90-pack.Dockerfile's 'factory-root' target
                   exports, written to _out/<board>/) into DIR, as a root tree
                   this can compare. DIR must not already hold anything.

exit codes -- the contract the gate driver reads:
  0  compared: every difference is sanctioned, every active sanction matched
     something, and no pending sanction has come live.
  1  compared, and the ledger does not account for the result: an unsanctioned
     difference, an active sanction that matched nothing, or a pending sanction
     that now matches. The report names each.
  2  REFUSED -- no comparison was made. A side that is missing, is not a
     directory, is empty or is under the path floor; both sides being one
     directory; a ledger that is absent or unparseable; no getcap to read file
     capabilities with. These are separate from 1 because a gate that cannot
     tell "the roots agree" from "nothing was compared" is not a gate.

The counters are printed on every run, including the passing ones: "no
differences" and "nothing was examined" reach the same verdict by opposite
routes, and the path counts are what separate them.
