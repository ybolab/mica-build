// Two unpacked roots, one written sanction ledger, and the classified set of
// differences between them.
//
// PLAN-036 section 6 ends with the gate this exists to serve: before the old
// rootfs stage chain is deleted, x64 is built through BOTH paths -- the chain
// and the package composer -- and their unpacked trees are compared. Package
// documentation and the package composition record are expected additions;
// "every other difference requires an explicit explanation". This module is
// where "an explicit explanation" stops being a sentence in a plan and becomes
// a file that fails a build when it is missing.
//
// The gate driver that builds both paths is not here -- it lands with the
// composer. What is here is the seam it calls: two directories, a ledger, and
// an exit code. src/compare-roots-cli.ts states that contract in its usage text
// and tests/dual-build-sanctions.md states it again in its header, because
// the caller reads one of the two and should not have to find the other.
//
// Two rules make this an instrument rather than a report:
//   - a difference no sanction covers fails the run, named;
//   - a sanction that covered nothing ALSO fails the run, named. A stale
//     sanction that silently matches nothing is how this stops asking the
//     question it was built for -- the tree changes, the sanction goes on
//     sanctioning an absence, and the run stays green by comparing less.

 * `--xattrs --xattrs-include='*'` because file capabilities live in an xattr
 * and an extraction that dropped them would compare two empty sets and agree.
