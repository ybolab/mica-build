// THIS FILE PARSES NOTHING. build-env/from.sh is the tree's one resolver:
// it reads images.env, refuses a key that is missing, a value still PENDING, a
// value that is a TAG rather than a digest, and a reference that is not well
// formed -- each with a sentence naming the key and the file. R6 removed the
// last floating tag from the shipping path by routing eighteen call sites
// through it, and a second reader of that file here would be the nineteenth
// place for the pin to be wrong.
//
// So this is a subprocess, not a parser. What it adds over the bare call is
// the two failures a caller of `docker run` would otherwise absorb silently:
// an empty answer, and a from.sh that could not be found at all.
