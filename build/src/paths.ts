// Where this package sits, and the proof that it still does.
//
// The reasoning is verify/src/paths.ts's and the helper IS its function,
// imported through verify-package.ts rather than copied. Counted `..` over
// directories always produces a path, so a stale count fails later on an empty
// directory rather than an absent one; every ascent here is anchored on
// something that must be at the destination, and the failure names the path.
//
// Two anchors verify does not have: verify itself, because the board
// model build stands on lives there (see verify-package.ts) and naming it
// here tells a reader which of the two packages moved instead of a bare
// "Cannot find module" from bun; and build-env/from.sh, which src/images.ts
// hands to bash, where a wrong path surfaces as "No such file or directory"
// attached to an image key and reads as though the key were bad.
