// The seam: how an external tool is run, and the only place in build that
// decides.
//
// verify has one of these for bun (verify/run.sh's run_bun: two routes,
// one function, callers that cannot tell which answered). This is the same
// shape one level down, for the toolset the assemblers drive -- sgdisk, mtools,
// dd, mkimage, veritysetup, e2fsprogs and rauc.
//
// Nothing here swallows a failure. run() returns the exit status, stdout and
// stderr, and decides nothing; must() throws a ToolError carrying all of it
// plus the argv and the route. A tool whose failure signal is NOT its exit
// status -- debugfs exits 0 and writes to stderr -- is handled by its own
// wrapper in src/tools/, which is why this layer refuses to interpret.

// THERE IS ONE ROUTE, AND IT IS THE CONTAINER. Every tool this file runs is a
// producer by docs/design/build.md section 0 -- sgdisk, mtools, mke2fs,
// mkimage, veritysetup, rauc -- so its own build decides the bytes of the
// image, and the image is what ships. A host route would make "which tool
// wrote these bytes" a property of the machine that happened to run the build.
//
// It used to measure the host and prefer it when the whole toolset was there.
// Three things in the tree say why that was the wrong default, and one of them
// is this host:
//
//   - `command -v mkfs.vfat` here answers /build/bin/busybox/mkfs.vfat --
//     BusyBox v1.37.0, which does not know `--invariant`, the flag both
//     assemblers pass to make FAT reproducible. The presence check the host
//     route was guarded by says yes to it. (Measured 2026-09-04.)
//   - this host's e2fsprogs is 1.46.5, too old for `-O ^orphan_file`, which is
//     the measured reason pin_seeded_times has always run container-side.
//   - src/toolsets.ts: "which package provided mkfs.vfat or mksquashfs is
//     exactly the kind of thing that decides bytes".
//
// So `MOS_BUILD_TOOLBOX=host` and `route: 'host'` are REFUSALS now rather than
// instructions, and they name the policy. A route that is ignored teaches
// nothing; a route that refuses says where the rule is written.
//
// A toolbox is opened once -- image resolved, container started, packages
// installed, every tool asserted present -- and each call is a `docker exec`
// into it. Measured on this host, 2026-08-25: `docker run --rm <alpine> true`
// is ~320 ms and `docker exec <running> true` ~40 ms, with the apk that
// provides the toolset ~1.3 s on top of every run. An assembler makes tens of
// calls, so a container per call would spend more time starting containers than
// writing filesystems and would reinstall the toolset from the network each
// time. It also makes container-side steps ordinary: pin_seeded_times' dumpe2fs
// and debugfs are two more calls into the same session.
