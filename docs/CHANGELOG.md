# Changelog

Campaign-level record, one entry per plan, newest first. Details live in the
plan file and the task records it names; this file holds the one-paragraph
history a reader can scan without opening either.

## PLAN-029 — Documentation system rebuild (2026-08-29)

The documentation tree went from 276 files and 77,319 lines to 42 files and
17,306, and stopped being coupled to code positions. Delivered as one record,
RFCT-262, because record proliferation was one of the things being removed.

- **Decoupled from code.** 3,843 `path:line` citations are gone from the
  documents, along with the gate that kept them resolvable
  (`docs/verify-citations.sh`, its test and three baselines — 1,821 lines, two
  `Makefile` targets and a CI step). Documents now name a module or a contract.
  The HTTP surface defers to `os/pkgs/mosd/apid/openapi.json`, which CI already
  holds equal to what the shipped binary prints and diffs for breaking changes —
  moving the API surface off an ungated prose transcription and onto a gated
  artifact. api.md's transcribed route table and operation inventory collapsed
  accordingly; its design reasoning stayed.
- **Settled records pruned.** 205 completed `RFCT-*` and 24 closed `PLAN-*`
  deleted, both indexes rewritten to the survivors. RFCT-257 and RFCT-261 were
  closed rather than kept: both were work scoped against the citation gate this
  campaign removed, so leaving them open would have left the tree with a task to
  build on machinery that no longer exists.
- **Re-anchored on the current version.** `docs/research/` deleted with the
  Venus OS comparison it existed for; the eight `*.zh.md` siblings replaced by
  `docs/zh/`, written against the tree rather than translated from a moving
  target. mosd.md was a M2 brief under five dated amendments claiming schema v4
  in one heading and v7 in another while the code is at v8, and five reconcilers
  where seven are registered; the amendments are collapsed into one statement of
  where the design stands.
- **Tests.** Measurement did not support a broad prune — `os/verify` runs a
  0.84 test-to-source ratio and `os/build` 1.06, close to one test file per
  module — so only what lost its subject went: the citation gate's negative
  suite, and `os-layout-lint-test`, a filename filter over a suite
  `os-verify-test` runs whole and which nothing invoked. `test/apid-api` is
  recorded as the manual harness it already was. The index gate's negative suite
  stayed green at 17/17; its plan cases now mint their own completed plan rather
  than borrowing a real one the pruning rule would delete.

Left open deliberately: 97 references to deleted records remain in 24 non-docs
files, mid-sentence in doc comments and in the generated `openapi.json`. They
resolve in the history, and clearing them costs a 24-file prose edit plus a
regeneration.

**Amendment 1 (same day).** Two things the milestones left short. Code no
longer cites task or plan records at all — 390 references across 125 files,
including the doc comments `utoipa` publishes into `openapi.json`, so an API
client was being shown `docs/task/RFCT-210.md`. The document was regenerated
from the corrected source, never hand-edited. Doing that surfaced two classes
M1's own dangling check had missed by requiring a `.md` suffix: 179 record
references in the living design documents and 94 pointers at the deleted
`docs/research/`. Both are now zero. `docs/zh/design/` also grew from six
documents to all sixteen.

## PLAN-021 — The defect and debt batch (2026-08-28)

Fifteen of the sixteen filed tasks closed: RFCT-094, RFCT-096, RFCT-129
through RFCT-134, and RFCT-136 through RFCT-142; the sixteenth, RFCT-135,
grew into PLAN-022 rather than closing here. Alongside the filed batch,
RFCT-180 delivered the M1 quick-fix batch (test timeouts, the audit-trail
flake, dead instructions and dead code), and RFCT-190/191 ran the M3 ghost
sweeps — stale provenance references across os/** re-measured and repointed
or dated, plus the docs-side re-measures, owner sweep, and gate repairs.

The five defect clusters, by outcome:

- **Credential and auth**: the admin password is changeable after setup
  (RFCT-134), /healthz states what it actually checks (RFCT-131), and one
  outage no longer reports as both 502 and 503 (RFCT-140).
- **API/bus plumbing**: uptime comes from mosd instead of apid's own
  /proc read (RFCT-129), the three settings failures reach the API as
  distinct errors (RFCT-130), per-request GetSettings round trips are
  cached (RFCT-132), and apid receives mosd's SettingsChanged (RFCT-133).
- **Hardening**: apid's unit sandboxes the filesystem it serves
  (RFCT-137), cargo-deny enforces the no-C posture it previously only
  named (RFCT-138), the unreachable bundle store's fate is decided and
  recorded (RFCT-136), and the traversal guards gained over-the-wire
  coverage with a bundle-carrying fixture (RFCT-141).
- **Device**: the U-Boot boot-credit read is ordered against writers
  (RFCT-142), and the production keyring provisioning path is documented
  and testable while staying fail-closed (RFCT-139).
- **Test honesty**: dotted keys' missing item objects are certain rather
  than theoretical (RFCT-094), and "0 skipped" no longer hides skips
  (RFCT-096).
