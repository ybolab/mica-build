#
# This is the producer's PREPARE hook, named in os/boards/cx3576/deb/board-cx3576/producer.env
# and run by the driver -- it is not an entry point and does not build anything:
#
#   [BOARD_DIR=...] bash os/build-env/deb/build.sh \
#       --producer board-cx3576 --arch arm64
#
# The driver empties ${MOS_DEB_STAGE}, exports the hook environment
# os/build-env/deb/README.md documents, runs this script on the HOST
# before any container is started, and then hands the directory to the build as
# the `bin` context.
#
# Three things force a host-side step here, and no other producer in the family
# needed one:
#
#   - BOARD_DIR. os/rootfs/build-v2.sh takes prebuilt BSP artifacts from
#     ${BOARD_DIR:-os/boards/<b>/bsp}, and this producer accepts the same
#     override. A build context in producer.env is a fixed repository-relative
#     path -- that file is plain KEY=value with no expansion, deliberately --
#     so a directory chosen by an environment variable cannot be named there.
#   - The refusal. A missing BSP input must be reported BEFORE anything is
#     built; inside the Dockerfile it would be reported after buildkit has
#     already resolved the base, transferred the contexts and started a stage.
#   - os/pkgs/rauc/render-config.sh, which is INVOKED rather than reimplemented
#     or copied from. It derives its own repository root from its location and
#     reads three files this producer does not own, so it runs where the
#     repository is: here.
#
# Everything that is a function of committed content alone -- the hwinit split,
# the firmware selection, the modules unpack, the payload's modes and symlinks
# -- is in the Dockerfile, where the rest of the producer family keeps it.
