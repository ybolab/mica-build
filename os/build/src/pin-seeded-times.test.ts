// pin_seeded_times, against a real seeded filesystem.
//
// THE CLAIM UNDER TEST IS NOT "it runs" -- it is that two filesystems seeded
// from trees whose inode times differ come out BYTE-IDENTICAL afterwards, and
// that they do not without it. Both halves are here, because the first alone is
// satisfied by a pass that does nothing at all: an empty command file makes
// debugfs exit 0 with a clean stderr, and a filesystem that was already
// identical stays identical.
//
// The two stage trees are made to differ DETERMINISTICALLY, by `touch -a` on one
// of them. That sets atime and, because no syscall sets ctime, bumps ctime as
// well -- which is exactly the pair os/mkimage-common.sh identifies as the
// assembler's noise rather than the producer's data. Waiting for a wall clock to
// tick between two copies would test the same thing on a machine slow enough and
// nothing on a machine that is not.
