// pin_seeded_times, ported: every in-use inode's atime and ctime rewritten to
// FILE_MTIME, in place, in a finished filesystem.
//
// Only a filesystem seeded with `mke2fs -d` needs it, and it is the difference
// between "EPHEMERAL is seeded" and "EPHEMERAL rebuilds byte-identically":
// without it two builds differ in 106 bytes of the inode table, spanning every
// inode the seed created.
// mtime is deliberately left alone -- it is the producer's data, carried in
// through the copy, not something an assembler invents. crtime is mke2fs's own
// invention and E2FSPROGS_FAKE_TIME already pins it; that is all it can pin,
// and it does not reach times copied in from a source tree. The three
// primitives this stands on are wrapped in src/tools/e2fsprogs.ts; the
// free-inode-range parse and the atime/ctime generation are here, in their only
// home, because both assemblers need them and they must not be written twice.

// mke2fs -d copies the source inode's atime, mtime and ctime into the image,
// and two of the three are the assembler's noise rather than the exported
// tree's content:
//
//   ctime  The assembler copies the factory /var out of _out before seeding, so
//          the stamp can be added without writing into _out, and the kernel
//          stamps every copied inode's ctime with the moment of that copy. NO
//          syscall sets ctime -- not touch, not utimensat -- so the only way to
//          pin it is to write the inode table, which is what this does.
//   atime  cp -a preserves the source's atime, and reading the source to make
//          the first copy is itself what bumps it under relatime, so assembly 2
//          seeds EPHEMERAL with a timestamp assembly 1 created and the two
//          images differ in a field neither build was asked about.
