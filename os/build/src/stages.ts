 * -- comes from the layer cache the first invocation just filled, so this costs
 * the export and not the build. Deliberately no --no-cache even when the chain

 * must not replay an earlier run's cache, and this invocation must be a replay
 * of the run that finished seconds ago. Passing it would rebuild all nine
 * stages and export a different root from the one the assembler is about to
 * consume -- two roots per build, differing for the reasons os/rootfs/README.md
 * records, with nothing to say which was smoke-tested.
 *
 * What makes it reproduce, measured on the real 250 MB export of the x64 root:
 *
 *   SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is load-bearing, pinning the image config's `created`;
 *   without it two exports of one already-built root give two different
 *   archives.
 *
 *   rewrite-timestamp is load-bearing only when the layer is genuinely rebuilt,
 *   which is the case that matters and the one a convenient experiment misses:
 *   two cold rebuilds of the pack stage without it give two different archives,
 *   with it byte-identical and equal to the warm build's. From a warm cache it
 *   changes the bytes but both runs still agree, so measuring it warm would
 *   have "proved" it unnecessary. It also conflicts with loading -- buildkit
 *   refuses `rewrite-timestamp` together with `unpack`, which is what `--load`
 *   does -- so the export cannot both reproduce and land in the image store. It
 *   reproduces; `docker load -i` is the caller's step.
 *
 *   --provenance/--sbom are not load-bearing here and are kept anyway: omitting
 *   them gives the identical archive, because buildx 0.32.2 adds no attestation
 *   to a `type=oci` export. It does add one to a `--load`, which is where this
 *   was first seen, and the default has moved between buildx versions before.
