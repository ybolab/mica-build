//
// Failure signal: the exit status. On success dd writes its summary to stderr,
// so a wrapper reading "stderr is not empty" as failure fails every correct run
// of it, and one reading "stderr is empty" as success passes every failed
// debugfs run (the opposite case, in e2fsprogs.ts). Each tool's signal is its
// own, which is why toolbox.run() interprets nothing. `status=none` silences
// the summary and both assemblers pass it; it is a parameter rather than a
// default, because a silenced dd is harder to debug.
//
// Reading bytes back out of an image is not here: os/mkimage-v2.sh checks the
// loader magic with `dd ... | od -An -tx1 -N4`, the image is a file on the host
// so a caller reads it with node:fs, and `docker exec` would route binary
// through a text stream that corrupts at the first non-UTF-8 byte.
