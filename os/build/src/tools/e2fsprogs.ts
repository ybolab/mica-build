// interprets none of them: mke2fs by exit status; dumpe2fs by exit status plus
// a header this parser understands (an unreadable field is refused, not
// defaulted); debugfs mostly by its stderr, measured below. All of it runs in
// the toolbox's container: the layouts ask for `-O ^orphan_file`, which needs
// e2fsprogs >= 1.47, and this host carries 1.46.5 -- os/mkimage-x64.sh says the
// same of its own host ("It runs INSIDE the container, because the host cannot:
// mke2fs 1.46.5, no sgdisk, no mcopy"). The timestamp-pinning pass is
// deliberately not here: which of an inode's four timestamps are noise, why the
// inode set comes from the bitmap rather than a walk of the source tree, and
// why debugfs's stderr is the failure signal are one argument and one module;
// this file provides its three primitives.

//
//   rc 0, banner only:  valid commands on a real filesystem; empty command file
//   rc 0, with text:    bad argument ("File not found"); image is not a
//     filesystem ("Bad magic number"); image is not there ("No such file")
//   rc 1:               unknown command ("Command not found"); command file is
//     not there ("No such file")
//
// Three failure shapes exit 0 and two exit 1, so neither signal alone is the
// verdict and both are read below; the empty command file is the row neither
// signal carries, and debugfsApply refuses it.
