// veritysetup: the dm-verity hash tree.
//
// FAILURE SIGNAL. Its exit status -- and, for `format`, ONE MORE that the exit
// status does not carry: the root hash is its ANSWER, printed on stdout, and a
// run that produced no readable one has failed whatever it exited with.
// os/rootfs/Dockerfile.v2 pipes it through awk and then asserts `test -n
// "${root_hash}"`, and that assertion is the whole reason this wrapper parses
// rather than returning text: an empty root hash propagates into a kernel
// cmdline, and a device that cannot assemble /dev/dm-0 stops at "ALERT!
// /dev/dm-0 does not exist" with nothing to say why.
//
// REPRODUCIBILITY. `--salt` and `--uuid` both default to RANDOM values, and the
// UUID lands in the verity superblock at the hash offset -- so leaving either
// unset makes the image differ on every run. Both are required fields here.
//
// WHOSE TOOL THIS IS. Neither disk assembler runs veritysetup: the rootfs build
// formats the tree (M5) and the image verifier walks it (M4), and the
// assemblers only dd the finished image into a slot. It is wrapped here because
// M6a's scope names it and because the two callers that will want it are both
// in this campaign; it has its own toolset for the same reason (see
// src/toolsets.ts).
