# os/rootfs/stages/90-pack.Dockerfile packs `pack`'s /rootfs into a squashfs and
# exports the same /rootfs as an OCI image. The smoke run executes binaries in
# the second and the device ships the first, so if the two are not one tree the
# smoke run is a check on something adjacent to the artifact.
#
# Four comparisons and not one: `diff -r` cannot see a mode, a uid or a gid; a
# listing cannot see a byte; neither can see a file capability, which lives in
# an xattr that has to survive a buildkit layer export to reach either side; and
# none of the three can see a hardlink becoming two files. A COPY that changed
# what it staged moves a mode or a path before it moves a byte.
#
# Any difference exits non-zero: a script that printed the differing rows and
# exited 0 would be a report and not a gate.
