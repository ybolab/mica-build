Installs the dev dependencies if they are missing, typechecks src/, then runs
the suite. Any extra arguments are passed to `bun test` (a filename filter, for
example). Every step must pass; nothing here skips.

With --lint FIRST, it runs the board-definition schema lint over the named
layouts instead of the suite -- `make os-layout-lint`. Same install, same
typecheck, same bun; only the last step differs. The flag has to come first so
that it can never be mistaken for a `bun test` filter.

With --verify FIRST, it runs the image verifier -- `make os-verify-<board>-v2`.
It runs the os/verify check register against one assembled image and prints one
PASS/FAIL/SKIP line per conclusion and a RESULT line, which is what
The predecessor shell verifier printed before this package replaced it. Its remaining
arguments are the verifier's own; try --verify --help. Unlike the two above it
needs DOCKER whatever else this host has -- it reads the image with the tools in
IMAGE_ALPINE_3_21 -- and on a host with no bun it runs in a second pinned image,
IMAGE_BUN_1 plus the client pinned as IMAGE_DOCKER_CLI_28, with the daemon
socket mounted. That is a privilege grant, taken only in this mode.

With --smoke FIRST, it runs the smoke runner: it loads
_out/<board>/factory-root.oci -- the packed root the build exports as an OCI
image -- and EXECUTES every self-built artifact inside it, requiring exit 0 and
that the version each one reports equals the version this repository pinned. It
needs DOCKER for the same reason --verify does and one stronger: the whole point
is to run the shipped binaries, and they are built for the board rather than for
this host. It refuses rather than skipping when the image is absent.

With --smoke-negative FIRST, it runs the three negative tests: it builds
three images from that board's factory root, each carrying one deliberately made
defect -- a wrong-arch binary, a binary whose NEEDed library has been taken away,
and a binary that reports a version other than its pin -- and requires the smoke
run to go red on each, naming the right cause and no other artifact. Every
mutation asserts its own before-and-after and fails the image BUILD rather than
producing an unmutated image, so a case cannot pass without having made its
defect. Same docker requirement as --smoke, for the same reason plus one: it
builds images.

A host with no bun runs the same steps in the bun container pinned by digest as
IMAGE_BUN_1 in os/build-env/images.env. That route is taken automatically; it
needs docker, and it is announced on the first line of output so a run is never
ambiguous about which bun produced it. For --verify the image is IMAGE_BUN_1
plus the docker client pinned as IMAGE_DOCKER_CLI_28, built here on demand --
see os/verify/Dockerfile.
