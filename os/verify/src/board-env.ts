// A board definition, read as DATA.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL. `os/boards/<board>/board.env` is the single
// source of truth for a board, and every consumer so far has read it by
// `source`-ing it. That works because the shell will evaluate anything --
// which is the whole problem: sourcing a board definition executes it. A key
// whose value is `$(rm -rf /)` is not a lint finding, it is a command that has
// already run by the time any checker looks at the parsed result. The file is
// data; nothing here ever hands it to a shell.
//
// So this is a parser for the DIALECT the real board definitions are written
// in -- assignments, comments, quotes, `${NAME}` and `$((arithmetic))` -- and
// a refusal, by name, for everything else that would have been shell. The
// refusal is the point. A parser that quietly skipped a line it did not
// understand would produce a board definition missing a key, and a missing key
// makes a shared script fail somewhere far from the omission (which is the
// failure os/verify/lint.sh's own header records).
//
// WHAT IT ACCEPTS, and every one of these shapes is in a real board.env today:
//
//   KEY=value                     bare
//   KEY="two words, and an ="     double quoted; expansions active
//   KEY='literal $NOT_EXPANDED'   single quoted; nothing is
//   KEY="${OTHER}"                a reference to a key declared ABOVE it
//   KEY="lit ${OTHER} @SLOT@"     interpolation mixed with literal text
//   KEY=$((A * B / C))            integer arithmetic over earlier keys
//   KEY=""                        declared, and empty -- NOT the same as absent
//   # a comment                   whole-line, or trailing after a value
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, each with its own message naming the construct:
// command substitution in either spelling, backticks, every parameter
// expansion operator (`${X:-y}` and friends), the shell special parameters,
// unquoted whitespace, unquoted metacharacters and globs, line continuations,
// `export`/`local`/`readonly` prefixes, an unterminated quote, a reference to
// a key this file does not define, and anything in `$(( ))` outside integer
// arithmetic.
//
// THE DEFAULT-VALUE REFUSAL IS THE SUBTLE ONE. `${RAUC_GRUBENV:-}` is the
// idiom every consumer of these files uses, and it is exactly what makes a
// shell reader unable to tell "declared empty" from "not declared". x64
// declares BOARD_FIRMWARE_FILES="" and BOARD_HWINIT_CONFS="" ON PURPOSE -- the
// emptiness is the statement -- and `${X:-}` renders that identical to a board
// that forgot them. This parser keeps the two apart and refuses to let a
// board.env itself paper over the difference.
