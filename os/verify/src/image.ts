// Reading a mos disk image without touching the host.
//
// The typed helpers M4b..M4d port checks on top of. The toolset is
// os/verify-image-v2.sh's, unchanged and deliberately so -- sgdisk for the
// GPT, mtools at an offset for the FAT boot slots, a byte range extracted out
// of the image and read with debugfs/tune2fs for the ext4 partitions,
// unsquashfs for the packed root, and `veritysetup verify`, which walks the
// hash tree in USERSPACE and never creates a device-mapper target, never calls
// losetup and never mounts anything. No loop mounts, no host mutation, nothing
// that needs root.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS REALLY ABOUT: TOOLS THAT SUCCEED AT NOTHING.
//
// Every helper below was driven against a malformed input before it was
// written, on 2026-08-25 in the pinned alpine:3.21 with the package set the
// shell verifier installs. Four of the five tools answer a question they could
// not answer with something that reads exactly like an answer:
//
//   sgdisk -p FILE, on 64 MiB of zeros with no partition table at all:
//       prints "Creating new GPT entries in memory.", INVENTS a random disk
//       GUID, lists zero partitions, and EXITS 0. `sgdisk --verify` on the same
//       file prints "No problems found." -- a green about a file that has no
//       GPT. (os/verify-image-v2.sh:1397 greps that sentence out too, which is
//       where the discriminator below comes from; it is the tool's own
//       statement that it found none.)
//
//   debugfs -R "ls -p /" FILE, on a file that is not ext4:
//       EXITS 0, prints NOTHING on stdout, and puts "Filesystem not open" on
//       stderr. A caller reading the exit status gets an empty directory
//       listing for a filesystem it never opened.
//
//   unsquashfs -d DEST ARCHIVE some/path/not/in/it:
//       EXITS 0 and creates an empty DEST. A caller that then reads DEST/some
//       /path finds nothing, and the reason it finds nothing is indistinguish-
//       able from the file being empty in the image.
//
//   veritysetup verify ... :
//       exits 1 BOTH for "Verification of root hash failed." -- which is a real
//       answer, the failing direction of the check -- and for "Device X is not
//       a valid VERITY device." -- which is not an answer at all. A helper that
//       mapped status 1 to `false` would report a corrupt payload for a
//       mis-computed offset.
//
// So no helper here decides anything by exit status alone. Each one knows what
// its tool's output looks like when the tool actually did the work, and refuses
// -- loudly, naming the tool and what it saw -- when it did not. The check
// above decides what a failure MEANS; the helper never decides it by silence.
// This is the same rule tools.ts states for ToolError, one layer up.
//
// The shell verifier ends nearly every capture in `|| true` and lets the
// resulting empty string fail the check. That works there because the check
// still goes red -- but it goes red describing a VALUE when the truth is that
// the tool never ran, and this campaign has spent whole tasks on the difference
// between those two sentences.

// DRIVEN FROM THE FAILING SIDE, 2026-08-26, in the pinned alpine:3.21 with the
// package set the shell verifier installs. fdtget is the FIRST tool in this
// file that refuses honestly on every input it cannot read -- and it still has
// one shape that answers a question it could not answer:
//
//   fdtget ZEROS.bin /leds/status-red label   (64 MiB of zeros)
//       exit 1, EMPTY stdout, `Error at '/leds/status-red': FDT_ERR_BADMAGIC`
//       on stderr. Where sgdisk INVENTS a GPT on the same input, libfdt names
//       the magic it did not find.
//   fdtget EMPTY.bin ...                      exit 1, FDT_ERR_BADMAGIC
//   fdtget nosuch.dtb ...                     exit 1, `Couldn't open blob from
//                                             'nosuch.dtb': No such file or directory`
//   fdtget T.dtb /leds/status-green label     exit 1, FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND
//   fdtget T.dtb /leds/status-red nosuch      exit 1, FDT_ERR_NOTFOUND
//
//   fdtget -t x T.dtb /leds/status-red label  exit 0, `73 74 61 74 75 73 2d 72 65 64 0`
//       ^^ THE ONE THAT ANSWERS ANYWAY. `-t x` on a STRING property does not
//       refuse: it prints the string's BYTES as cells. So a device tree whose
//       `gpios` had become a string would hand the oracle's
//       `gpio_cells[2]` the third byte of that string -- a plausible-looking
//       hexadecimal number -- rather than a refusal. It is REPRODUCED here and
//       not refused, because os/verify-image-v2.sh:1941 reads exactly those
//       cells and a helper that threw would fail where the oracle FAILS THE
//       CHECK, which is a different row in the parity diff.
//
//   fdtget T.dtb /leds/status-red gpios       exit 0, `107 29 1`   (DECIMAL)
//   fdtget -t x T.dtb /leds/status-red gpios  exit 0, `6b 1d 1`    (hex)
//       The default radix is decimal and `-t x` is hexadecimal. The oracle
//       passes `-t x` and compares against 0 and 1, which read the same in
//       both -- so the flag is not decoration, it is the only thing that keeps
//       a flags cell of 10 from being compared as sixteen.
//
// WHY AN ABSENCE IS AN ANSWER HERE AND NOT A THROW. os/verify-image-v2.sh:1923
// writes `$(fdtget ... 2>/dev/null || true)` and compares the empty string
// against the wanted value, so on this tool every refusal is a FAILED CHECK
// rather than a broken run. That is the behaviour the port has to reproduce.
// What it does NOT reproduce is the collapse: `undefined` here means libfdt
// said so, in its own words, and a non-zero exit saying anything else still
// throws -- so "the dtb is not there" and "fdtget is not installed" cannot
// arrive at a check as the same value.
