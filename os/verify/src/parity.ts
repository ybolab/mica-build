// The parity harness: what the shell verifier concluded, what the TypeScript
// port concluded, and where the two differ -- per check.
//
// Nothing here runs a check: it parses one verifier's output, takes the other's
// results, and says by name, per check, agree / diverge / not ported.
//
// By name and not by count, following os/tests/ui-location-test.sh: "395 checks
// both sides" is equally true of two runs that agreed on 395 and of two that
// agreed on none because both were empty, and M3a's board-env oracle reported
// agreement "on all 0 keys" for exactly that reason. A SKIP is a third verdict
// that never equals a PASS, so pass-vs-skip is a named divergence rather than
// noise in a total.
//
// Identity is assigned rather than parsed. os/verify-image-v2.sh (deleted) prints
// `PASS: <prose>`, `FAIL: <prose>`, `SKIP: <prose>` and nothing else -- measured
// on both boards' real images 2026-08-25, every one of 398 and 312 stdout lines
// is a verdict line or the final RESULT line -- but the prose is not an
// identifier: `eq_ci` prints "X is Y" passing and "X is 'Z', expected Y"
// failing. So each ported check carries a substring from its PASS line, plus
// separate substrings for FAIL and SKIP where the directions do not share one,
// as a field on the CheckCase rather than a file that could drift from it. The
// shell verifier is NOT modified to emit ids: an oracle edited to make its
// readings easier to compare is not independent of the thing it measures.
//
// `not-ported` is a first-class outcome, counted separately from agreement, and
// a run with any of them concludes INCOMPLETE and never PASS.
