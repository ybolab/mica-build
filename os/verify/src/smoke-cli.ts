//
// Prints one line per artifact and one RESULT line, which is the
// shape `src/verify-cli.ts` already established for the image contract, so a
// reader of one run knows how to read the other.
//
// The argument parser refuses what it does not know, deliberately and for the
// reason run.sh's "has to be the FIRST argument" refusal gives about `--lint`:
// an unknown option that is accepted and ignored turns a request for one thing
// into a green about another. There is no `--opt=value` form for the same
// reason -- values come from the next argv element, so `--board=x64` is an
// error that names itself rather than a board called `=x64`.
//
// Cited by content and not by line number, which this file got wrong once: the
// citation said `run.sh:98`, and adding `--smoke` to run.sh moved that refusal
// to line 127. A reference that the referring change itself invalidates is the
// reference rot this tree keeps having to repair.

const USAGE = `usage: bun run src/smoke-cli.ts [--board NAME]

Executes every self-built artifact inside that board's factory root and requires
the version it reports to equal the version pinned in this repository.

  --board NAME   which board's _out/<board>/factory-root.oci to smoke.
                 Defaults to MOS_BOARD, then to x64.
  --builder NAME the buildx builder to execute inside when this host's daemon
                 cannot execute the image's platform. Defaults to mos-<arch>
                 when such a builder exists; with neither, the run refuses.
  --help         this.

It refuses rather than skipping when the image is absent, when the register and
the version pins disagree, and when this host cannot execute the image at all.
