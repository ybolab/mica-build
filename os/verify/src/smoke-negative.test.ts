// RFCT-113 M7c. The cases themselves need a real image, a real container and a
// real mutated binary -- that is the whole point of them, and `make
// os-smoke-negative-test` is where they run. What lives here is everything that
// decides WHETHER THEY RUN AT ALL, because those decisions are exactly the ones
// that fail silently: an empty case list, a case naming an artifact the register
// does not have, a mutation body that is empty, a skew that is not a skew. Each
// of those produces a green run that measured nothing, and none of them needs a
// daemon to catch.
//
// The vacuity argument is `conclude`'s, one level up: `RESULT: PASS (3 of 3)` is
// invariant under a case list somebody emptied.
