// The three negative tests: a wrong-arch binary, a missing-soname binary and a
// version-skewed binary, each REALLY made and each required to turn the smoke
// run red.
//
// Not unit tests. smoke.ts reaches every verdict from a fabricated `ExecResult`,
// which is what makes the red branches runnable with no image, daemon or build
// -- but a fabricated result is a statement the test wrote. M7b's map said 126
// meant "a wrong-architecture binary, or a dynamic loader that could not resolve
// it"; measured, wrong-arch is 255, an unresolvable loader is 127, and 126 is a
// mode bit, and the suite stayed green because it chose the numbers. So each
// case here makes the defect in a real image, from the real factory root, with
// the real self-built artifact, and drives the real `docker run` at it.
//
// Every mutation refuses to be a no-op: each Dockerfile asserts its own pre- and
// post-state and exits non-zero if either is not what the mutation requires, so
// a no-op fails the image build naming what it expected. Every case carries its
// positive control, the same artifact through the unmutated root in the same
// pass, and names the diagnosis it must NOT get.
//
// It does not build a rootfs: it reads the factory root the build exported,
// exactly as the smoke runner does, and refuses when there is none, because a
// skip reports the same green as a pass.
