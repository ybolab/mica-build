// How a ported check spells its conclusion.
//
// Three constructors, in their own module so that the check batches can use
// them without importing the register they are part of.
//
// The MESSAGE is not the identity -- `parity.ts` pairs on (id, instance) and
// compares verdicts, and the whole reason the matcher lives on the check is
// that the oracle's prose is not an identifier. The message is what a reader
// sees on the TypeScript side of a divergence, next to the shell's own
// sentence, so it says the same FACT in the same units rather than paraphrasing
// the conclusion.
