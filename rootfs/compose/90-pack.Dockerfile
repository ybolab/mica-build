# stages/90-pack -- close the root, then pack it: squashfs-zstd + dm-verity.
# The last link in the chain (stages/README.md says what the chain is), and the
# only stage file with more than one FROM of its own.

# inventoried/captured preserve native inputs and the configured target tree.
# closed applies the existing device policy transformations in disposable state.
# pack-tools/pack run on the build platform, preserve the installed transfer,
# select an empty runtime tree offline, then measure and pack only that tree.
# factory-root exports the selected tree; factory-checked verifies that transfer.
# artifact exports the matching verity image, inventories and debug counterparts.

# Two export surfaces, not one, because they are different kinds of thing:
# `artifact` is files the assembler consumes, `factory-root` is an image a
# runtime consumes, and buildkit exports one target per invocation. The driver
# builds factory-root second, off the cache the first filled. `closed` is not a
# stage file of its own: closing the root and packing it are one operation with
# one output, nothing else can run between them, and a stage boundary that
# nothing can ever be inserted at only costs a reader a hop.

# The link back up the chain. MICA_STAGE_PREV is the local image tag the
# previous stage was written to; the driver passes it and refuses to build a
# stage that does not declare it. There is no default, so this file cannot be
# built standalone against whatever `FROM` happened to be typed.

# MICA_IMAGE_DEBIAN_BOOKWORM is this file's own base, injected from
# build-env/images.env by build-env/from.sh exactly as stages/10-base's
# trixie key is, and declared here because the `pack` FROM below is the only
# line in the chain that consumes it. It is pinned because the byte layout of
# the packed image depends on which squashfs-tools and cryptsetup pack it, so
# the pack tools are a decision rather than a build date. No default, for the
# reason 10-base gives.

#

# the .hwdb sources it is compiled from -- for a device whose hardware is fixed
# at manufacture. What that database supplies is descriptive: vendor and model
# strings, input-device quirks, autosuspend hints for laptop peripherals. None
# of it is a device this board has, and none of it is read by anything mos runs.
#
# HERE, IN `closed`, and not in `pack` below, for the reason the purge under it
# is here: this is a decision about the DEVICE ROOT rather than about the
# assembled tree, and TOTAL_MB is measured further down over the root that
# ships, so a removal after that point would leave the budget gate weighing
# bytes the image does not carry. Before the purge because the purge takes
# /var/lib/dpkg with it and the survivor checks want a root that is still a
# Debian system.
#
# THE RULE EDITS ARE THE CAREFUL PART. Thirteen shipped rule files query hwdb
# and almost all of them do something else in the same rule --
# 50-udev-default.rules assigns the tty, input and disk groups on lines that
# also import from it, 60-serial.rules builds /dev/serial/by-id, and
# 75-net-description.rules ends at IMPORT{builtin}="net_id". So the script
# removes CLAUSES, token by token, and then asserts by name that the actions
# sharing those lines are still there. A rule left with no action at all is
# dropped rather than shipped, because udev logs "takes no effect" for those.
#
# WHY NOT LEAVE THE RULES AND JUST DELETE THE DATABASE: a missing hwdb.bin does
# not make an IMPORT disappear, it makes it FAIL -- 33 failing builtin calls per
# matching uevent, forever. It also arms systemd-hwdb-update.service, whose
# conditions include `ConditionPathExists=|!/usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin`: deleting
# the database is exactly what makes that unit start running, against a
# read-only /usr, on every boot. The unit and its enablement go with the data.

# Reconcile the enablement links with the preset policy this root SHIPS

# hwdb removal is: it is a decision about the device root, TOTAL_MB is measured
# below over the root that ships, and the purge takes /var/lib/dpkg with it.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR, and it is not a duplicate of the preset files. A preset
# prevents a link from being WRITTEN, and mica-system's ssh rule works because
# apt unpacks that package before it configures openssh-server. cx3576's
# getty@tty1 rule cannot work that way: systemd is configured before the board
# package carrying the rule is unpacked, so the assembled image shipped the
# preset AND the link -- measured, on the first image built with it. The preset
# remains the decision that survives a `systemctl preset-all`; this step removes
# the link the decision was too late to prevent.
#
# It reads the policy rather than naming a unit, so it is board-agnostic code
# with a board-specific effect: cx3576 ships a `disable getty@.service` rule and
# x64 does not, and x64's VC getty is therefore untouched. Measured on the

# Remove package management from the packed root. Nothing can install a
# package on this device: the root is a read-only dm-verity squashfs and
# updates replace immutable signed root objects, so apt, dpkg and the perl-base dpkg
# pre-depends on are build-time tools. Shipping them costs ~21 MB of dead
# weight and hands a working package manager to anyone who reaches a shell on a
# device whose whole security model is that its root cannot change. The
# self-checks below are what make this step able to fail; a purge that silently
# removed too much would surface as a device that does not boot, days later.

# Measured before removing, not assumed. Nothing in overlay, in micad or in
# apid invokes dpkg or apt at runtime -- the only two mentions in the overlay
# are comments. Every perl script in the image is maintainer-script tooling
# that runs during installation and never after (deb-systemd-helper,
# deb-systemd-invoke, debconf-*, ucf*, and the /usr/sbin set: adduser, deluser,
# update-rc.d, pam-auth-update, pam_getenv, dpkg-fsys-usrunmess), and they are
# removed here too -- a script whose interpreter is gone is a trap, not a
# leftover. dash, grep and gzip declare `Pre-Depends: dpkg`, a packaging-time
# relation their binaries never call; gpgv is reachable only from apt-key.

# The checks test a property, not a package name -- a copyright count, a
# version glob -- because a check pinned to a version of the thing it is
# checking fails on the upgrade it exists to survive. The dangling-interpreter
# check below is a build failure and not a warning, because it is what
# enumerates the /usr/sbin set a hand survey misses. adduser and deluser are
# safe to remove for a second, independent reason: /etc/passwd is inside the
# read-only verity root (only /etc/shadow is symlinked onto STATE), so no
# account can be created on a running device whether or not the tool is there.

# The apt and dpkg timers go too. Removing /usr/bin/apt does not remove
# apt-daily.timer, apt-daily-upgrade.timer or dpkg-db-backup.timer, and all
# three are enabled by their packages into
# /etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants. On a device with no package manager
# they fire daily and fail daily, and nothing else in the image is wrong enough
# to notice.

# linux-base's four helpers and update-initramfs are NOT in the purge list any
# more, and their absence from it is the statement. They arrived with
# linux-base, which x64 pulled in through Debian's linux-image-amd64 and cx3576
# never installed. Since PLAN-074 x64 installs mos-kernel-x64 instead -- a
# payload of a bzImage, its config and its modules, with no Depends and no
# maintainer script -- so linux-base reaches neither board and there is nothing
# to remove. A purge of paths nothing can create reads like a safeguard and is
# not one.

# /usr/share/doc is kept, deliberately, and this is where the usual "slim
# image" recipe goes wrong: it is 2.75 MB, of which 2.06 MB is 159 `copyright`
# files -- the licence texts Debian ships to satisfy the redistribution terms
# of the GPL and friends. Deleting the directory would save 0.69 MB of
# changelogs and breach those terms to do it. coreutils (17.6 MB) and
# openssh-client (5.7 MB) are kept by decision too: busybox would save most of
# coreutils but every script in the image and in the verifier would then run
# against different tool semantics, and outbound ssh/scp is a field-support
# capability, not packaging residue.

#   -noappend             never merge into a pre-existing image
#   -no-exports           drop the NFS export table (unused, extra bytes)

# There is deliberately no -all-root, and no -force-uid/-force-gid either. They
# rewrite ownership but NOT mode bits, so every setgid binary whose group was
# not root would ship setgid-root: ssh-agent (_ssh), chage / expiry /
# unix_chkpwd (shadow), dbus-daemon-launch-helper (messagebus). That widens a
# privilege boundary inside the one part of the system that is supposed to be
# the trustworthy part. It also breaks unix_chkpwd in the other direction: it
# needs egid shadow to read /etc/shadow, and egid root does not grant that, so
# non-root PAM password verification stops working. Ownership does not need
# forcing to be deterministic -- it comes from a pinned base image and a pinned
# package set, and step 2 is what keeps it honest.

# uid/gid through untouched, and -all-root is exactly what breaks that. Diff
# the packed image's setuid/setgid inventory against the source inventory
# captured before packing, and fail the build on ANY difference, so this class
# of bug is a build error instead of something a reviewer has to spot.
# -lln prints numeric ids, matching how privileged-src.txt was written.

# random, and --no-superblock, and the two are one decision: without a
# superblock there is no UUID field left to randomise, so the salt is the only
# remaining source of variation and the pack stays reproducible with one pin
# instead of two.

# The native early loader uses the explicit no-superblock verity geometry
# bound by the signed root descriptor. Append the tree after the SquashFS data.

# The factory root as an OCI image.

# Eleven artifacts in this image are built by this repository -- micad, apid,
# mica-mqttd, mica-mqtt-broker, mica-deploy, podman, quadlet, crun, conmon, netavark,
# aardvark-dns -- and "it linked" and "it runs" are different claims: a
# wrong-architecture binary, a missing soname, or a version that does not match
# the pin in versions.env all survive to first boot. The smoke runner executes
# each of them before the image ships, and an executor needs a root to execute
# them in. This is that root, in the one form a container runtime can be handed
# directly.

# /runtime is the exact selection verified before mksquashfs. Installation,
# account configuration and the existing whole-var/shadow/DNS transformations
# are finished before this tree is copied. Disposable installation databases,
# archives and debug counterparts live outside the selected tree.

# There is no `--platform` flag here, so the stage is built for TARGETPLATFORM
# and the image declares the board's architecture, which is what makes `docker
# run` reach for binfmt/qemu-user on an arm64 image. Nothing in this stage
# executes anything from the root, so producing it needs no emulation even with
# binfmt_misc unmounted. Building the arm64 root is still gated on emulation;
# exporting one is not.

# A lossy COPY must fail here; final OCI serialization still needs B7 extraction.
