# THE DEVICE IDENTITY, /usr/share/mica/release-identity.env: the file
# the management service reads to decide which published release is for this device
# (board, profile) and whether one is newer than what is running (version).
# Three facts about THIS BUILD, which is why no package carries them: an
# archive is built once per architecture and installed into images of several
# boards and profiles, and the version it would have to state is the pool's
# rather than its own.
#
# HERE, on the composition path, and from build arguments only: no wall clock,
# no git, nothing read back out of the image. rootfs/build.sh passes
# MOS_BOARD and MOS_PROFILE -- the same two values it hands the resolver -- and
# MOS_RELEASE_VERSION, which is `bash build-env/deb/version.sh`'s answer for
# this tree, the same string it has already required the POOL to have been
# built at. So the identity moves with the pool the packages came out of, and
# the finalizer's /usr/share/mica/manifest.tsv, taken from the same dpkg
# database a few steps later, carries that version on every first-party row.
#
# MOS_RELEASE_COMMIT_DATE arrives the same way, and it is what micad reports as
# `system.commitDate`. It is the date of the commit INSIDE the version above --
# build.sh reads it out of the stamp it has already checked the pool against,
# so the two cannot come to name different commits -- and it is the one date in
# this root that a rebuild reproduces AND that says when the source was
# written. Every file time here is SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH, which is a constant, so
# without this line the only date an image could offer is one that is identical
# in every image ever built.
#
# The version, checked against a package that actually landed rather than
# taken on trust. build.sh's pool-stamp refusal is upstream of this and covers
# the tree-versus-pool case; what this covers is the seam between them -- an
# argument that arrived wrong, or a caller that composed the list another way
# -- and it is the same boundary-assertion reasoning as the profile count
# above. The upstream repacks (mica-podman) carry their own upstream
# version in front of the shared stamp and are expected not to match; the
# first-party packages are.

# NO INITRAMFS, asserted where the kernel and the root it must mount are
# finally in one tree together.
#
# This block used to assert the opposite. Until PLAN-074 x64 ran Debian's
# generic kernel, which has no CONFIG_DM_INIT and therefore ignored the
# dm-mod.create= verity table on the kernel command line; an initramfs
# re-implemented it, and what was checked here was that the initrd the kernel
# package's postinst had just built carried veritysetup and the local-top
# script. mos-kernel-x64 carries the device mapper, dm-verity and squashfs
# built in and reads that command line itself, so there is no initrd, no hook
# and no postinst run to get wrong.
#
# WHAT REPLACES IT IS NOT NOTHING. An absence proves itself only if something
# was there to look at, so this asserts three things rather than one: that the
# root carries exactly one kernel and the config it was built from, that the
# config declares the verity floor BUILT IN, and that no initrd file exists
# beside it. The first two are what would go red if Debian's kernel ever came
# back into this image -- its config has CONFIG_DM_INIT nowhere at all -- and
# the third is RFCT-281's guarantee in its stronger form: BusyBox cannot be an
# early-boot dependency of an image whose early boot has no userspace.
#
# Gated on a kernel being IN the root, which is an x64 fact: cx3576's kernel
# comes from its BSP and sits on the boot partition, so there is nothing here
# to look at. rootfs/scripts/pack-export-boot.sh makes the same assertions over
