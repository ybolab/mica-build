# PLAN-086 S4: take the static hardware database out of the shipped root.
#
# Called from rootfs/compose/90-pack.Dockerfile (closed stage), where the
# reasoning lives. Operates on `/` -- the device root itself, as the
# package-manager purge beside it does.
#
# WHAT GOES: /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin and /etc/udev/hwdb.bin, the two places the
# compiled database can sit; /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d and /etc/udev/hwdb.d, the
# source data it is compiled from; /usr/bin/systemd-hwdb and
# systemd-hwdb-update.service, the machinery that would recompile it; and the
# `IMPORT{builtin}="hwdb ..."` clauses in the shipped udev rules, which are the
# only thing that ever reads it. 22.9 MB on cx3576, of which 13.5 MB is the
# compiled database and 9.3 MB the sources it came from.
#
# WHAT STAYS, and this is the harder half: everything else in those rules.
# A rule that queries hwdb almost always does something else in the same rule --
# 50-udev-default.rules sets the tty/input/disk group and mode for the whole
# system on lines that also import from hwdb, 60-serial.rules creates
# /dev/serial/by-id and by-path, 75-net-description.rules ends at
# IMPORT{builtin}="net_id" -- so this removes CLAUSES and not files or lines.
# The survivor table below names, per file, the actions that must still be there
# when it is done, and the run fails if any of them is not.
#
# WHY THE FLAG GOES WITH THE QUERY. 60-evdev.rules sets a private
# ENV{.HAVE_HWDB_PROPERTIES}="1" in the SAME rule as each hwdb import, and later
# gates IMPORT{builtin}="keyboard" on it. Removing the import alone would leave
# the flag set unconditionally and turn a conditional keyboard import into an
# unconditional one -- a behaviour CHANGE made in passing by a removal. The flag
# is hwdb bookkeeping by construction (its value records that a hwdb lookup
# succeeded), so it is part of the clause. The `=="1"` consumer is left alone and
# simply never matches, which is exactly what it does on a root whose hwdb.bin
# is missing.
#
# WHY NOT JUST DELETE hwdb.bin AND LEAVE THE RULES. A missing database makes
# every `IMPORT{builtin}="hwdb ..."` fail at runtime rather than do nothing:
# 33 clauses on cx3576, attempted on every matching uevent, for a database that
# is never coming back. The plan's acceptance is "no active rule or unit still
# requires it", which a root full of failing imports does not satisfy.
#
# NETWORK INTERFACE NAMING IS THE ONE THING THAT COULD MAKE THIS NOT INERT, and
# it is measured rather than reasoned about. hwdb feeds naming through three
# properties -- ID_NET_NAME_FROM_DATABASE (NamePolicy=... database ...),
# ID_NET_NAME_INCLUDE_DOMAIN and ID_NET_AUTO_LINK_LOCAL_ONLY -- and the shipped
# sources set them for a Dell iDRAC virtual NIC, an Azure MANA adapter and four
# USB-to-USB bridges, none of which is on any board here. Every mos board also
# boots with net.ifnames=0 (BOARD_CMDLINE_ARGS in all three board.env files),
# which disables the whole NamePolicy path before hwdb is consulted at all.
# docs/task/RFCT-346.md carries the before/after `udevadm info` from a booted
# guest; this comment is the reason to look, not the evidence.

# itself and the private flag that records whether it succeeded. Only the
# ASSIGNMENT of that flag (`}="`) counts -- its `}=="` consumer stays, and
# counting it here would make the tally disagree with the rewrite by one per
# consumer and fail the equality below for the wrong reason.
