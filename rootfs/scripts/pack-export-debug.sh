# PLAN-086 S2: take the debug information out of the shipped binaries, and keep
# it where a reader can still resolve a core dump with it.
#
# Called from rootfs/compose/90-pack.Dockerfile (pack stage), where the
# reasoning lives. Operates on /rootfs -- the tree that goes into mksquashfs --
# and writes /out/debug/, which the `artifact` stage exports to
# _out/<board>/debug/.
#
# WHAT IS A CANDIDATE, and it is not "every ELF". RFCT-346 measured the root:
# 1,022 user-space ELF files, of which THIRTEEN carry any `.debug*`, `.symtab`
# or `.strtab` at all, and every one of the thirteen is built by this
# repository -- podman, netavark, apid, micad, crun, mica-mqttd, mica-mqtt-broker,
# rauc-update, rauc-verify, quadlet, aardvark-dns, catatonit, conmon. Debian
# ships its own binaries stripped, so the other 1,009 have nothing to take. The
# scan is written over the whole tree anyway, because a candidate LIST would be
# a second place to edit, and it would go stale the day a producer changes.
#
# KERNEL MODULES ARE NOT CANDIDATES and are excluded twice: by path, and by ELF
# type. A module's `.symtab` is what the module loader resolves its relocations
# against, so stripping one produces a module that no longer loads --
# PLAN-086's risk table says to treat them separately, and this is that
# separation. The path rule is what the tree's layout makes obvious; the type
# rule is what still holds for a relocatable object somewhere else. Both counts
# are printed, so neither can be the only one doing any work without that being
# visible.
#
# THE MATCH IS THE GNU BUILD ID, and it is asserted rather than assumed. A
# debug file that cannot be tied back to the binary it came from is worse than
# no debug file: it looks like diagnosability and resolves nothing. Each
# exported file is named `.build-id/<xx>/<rest>.debug`, which is where gdb and
# every other consumer of separated debug information looks. The note survives
# `strip` (it is allocated) and survives `--only-keep-debug`, and both facts are
# checked here on every file rather than trusted once. A binary with debug
# sections and no build-id is a REFUSAL, not a skip: it is a binary this
# repository would ship and could not afterwards debug.
#
# TARGET-AWARE TOOLS. This stage runs on the BUILD platform while /rootfs is
# the board's, so the host `objcopy` and `strip` are the wrong ones -- GNU
# binutils is configured per target, and the native tools would refuse the
# board's ELF rather than rewrite it correctly. MOS_ARCH picks the cross prefix;
# both prefixed toolchains are installed in the stage, so the apt layer is
# shared between the two architectures instead of keyed on one.
