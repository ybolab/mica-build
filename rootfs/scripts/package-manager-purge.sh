# THE ENABLEMENT OF THE MACHINERY THIS PURGE REMOVES, found by asking dpkg who
# OWNS each unit rather than by matching its name.
#
# apt ships apt-daily.timer and apt-daily-upgrade.timer, dpkg ships
# dpkg-db-backup.timer, and each ships the wants-symlink that enables it -- into
# /etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants, the level that overrides vendor
# defaults. On a root whose package manager is about to be deleted they fire
# daily and fail daily, and nothing else in the image is wrong enough to notice.
#
# THIS RUNS FIRST because it is the only step here that needs the dpkg database,
# and the `rm -rf` below deletes it. That ordering is the whole reason this
# check lives in this file rather than in the finalizer's residue stripper,
# which runs in the pack stage over a tree with no /var/lib/dpkg left.
#
# BY OWNERSHIP AND NOT BY NAME, and that is the point of the change. The old
# spelling removed nine literal paths and then asserted `find -name 'apt-daily*'
# -o -name 'dpkg-db-backup*'` found nothing -- so a fourth timer, shipped by apt
# or dpkg under any other name, survived the removal AND the assertion. The
# membership test is a set of PACKAGE names, which is the granularity the purge
# is actually about: it removes apt's and dpkg's binaries, so it removes what
# apt and dpkg enabled, whatever those units are called.
#
# The by-name assertion is KEPT, below, as the check on this mechanism rather
# than as the mechanism. If this sweep stops working, that assertion is what
# says so, and it can only say so because it no longer does the removing.

# LINK. Measured in a clean trixie root -- all four links under
# timers.target.wants answer "no package owns this path", while every unit they
# point at answers apt, apt, dpkg and util-linux. deb-systemd-helper writes
# those links from a maintainer script, so they are in no file list at all.

# every one of them, and the by-name assertion below caught it on the first real
# build -- both paths, identically, because this file is the shared finalizer.

# LINK is how maintainer-script enablement is IDENTIFIED); the two uses are
# opposite and the sentences describing them are nearly the same.

# It carried linux-base's four helpers (linux-check-removal, linux-run-hooks,
# linux-update-symlinks, linux-version), /usr/sbin/update-initramfs,
# veritysetup, cryptsetup, integritysetup and
# /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/mos-verity. Every one of them was x64's, and only
# x64's: that board took Debian's linux-image-amd64, which cannot read the
# dm-mod.create= verity table, so an initramfs re-implemented it and
# initramfs-tools, cryptsetup-bin and linux-base arrived with the kernel and
# board packages. Since PLAN-074 x64 installs mos-kernel-x64 -- a bzImage, its
# config and its modules, no Depends, no maintainer script -- so none of those
# packages is on either board and none of those paths can exist. A purge of
# paths nothing can create reads like a safeguard and is not one.
# The by-name check on the ownership sweep above. It names the three units this

# is the general statement and this is the instance that would notice the sweep
# breaking. It no longer removes anything -- that would make it the cure and the
# test at once, and a check that fixes what it is checking cannot fail.
