# mos-build-side: container -- this edits the composed root inside the pack
# stage; nothing in this repository's checkout is touched.
#
# Make the enablement links in the packed root agree with the preset policy the
# root ships, for the units that policy DISABLES.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY A PRESET FILE ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH. mos-system's
# 50-mos-ssh.preset works by ORDERING: apt unpacks that package's data before it
# configures openssh-server, so deb-systemd-helper reads the rule and never
# writes the link. PLAN-088 assumed the same ordering would hold for
# getty@tty1.service and 50-mos-getty.preset. Measured on the assembled image,
# it does not: the packed root shipped the preset AND
# /etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@tty1.service, because systemd is
# configured before the board package that carries the rule is unpacked. The
# preset is the right decision arriving too late to prevent the link.
#
# So both are needed and they do different jobs. The preset is the DECISION --
# it is what makes the state survive a `systemctl preset-all`, a new preset file
# or an upstream packaging change. This step is the RECONCILIATION -- it removes
# the link that was already there when the decision arrived. Removing the link
# without shipping the preset would be an absence rather than a decision, which
# is the failure mos-system's own comments describe at length.
#
# THE RESOLUTION IS IMPLEMENTED HERE RATHER THAN IMPORTED, and that is
# deliberate. verify/src/unit-state.ts implements the same systemd rule in
# TypeScript and verify/src/checks-display.ts asserts the OUTCOME over the
# packed root. Two independent readings of one rule, in two languages, with the
# checker as the oracle: if this enforcer's matching drifts, the check goes red
# rather than both agreeing with each other about the wrong thing.
#
# THE RULE, which is why none of this can be a grep for a `disable` line:
# preset files mask by BASENAME across /etc, /run and /usr/lib; the merged set
# is read in lexicographic order of that basename; and the FIRST rule matching
# the unit wins. A later `disable` behind an earlier `enable` is not policy, and
# a grep would find it anyway. A unit that NO rule matches presets to ENABLE.
#
# `systemctl --root ... preset` was measured and is not usable here: against the
# packed root it exits 0 and removes nothing for a template INSTANCE, while
# `systemctl --root ... disable getty@tty1.service` removes the link correctly.
# Rather than depend on that asymmetry -- and on running a foreign-architecture
# systemctl under emulation -- the link is unlinked directly, which is what
# rootfs/scripts/hwdb-remove.sh already does for the same job.
