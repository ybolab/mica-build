# PLAN-080's criterion is "a host with only Docker and git must be able to build
# and release an image, completely", widened by its section 1 to the smallest
# set that runs anything here at all: docker, git, bash, make and a busybox
# userland. Its section 4 climbed that ladder BY HAND, once, on 2026-09-04 --
# and its section 9 then named the absence of a re-run as the record's own
# largest risk, in its own words: "nothing re-runs it, so the next path that
# requires a host tool will pass every check in section 6 and break the
# criterion". This is that climb, on demand. Backlog B6.
#
# THE CONSTRAINT IS THE WHOLE VALUE. Everything below runs inside
# IMAGE_DOCKER_CLI_28 -- the image build-env/images.env already pins for another
# reason, and the substrate section 4 used. No PATH trick on this host would do:
# a stripped PATH is a claim about a lookup, and the criterion is a claim about a
# machine. And the surface is MEASURED rather than trusted: substrate.sh asserts
# what the image carries before anything is added, and ladder.sh asserts that no
# producer in tests/host-toolchain-lint.sh's table is reachable after.
#
# WHY bash AND make ARRIVE AS `apk add` AND NOT AS A DERIVED IMAGE. A derived
# image is a second thing that can gain content between the pin and the run,
# and it would move the one fact this gate exists to hold -- what is on the
# host -- into a Dockerfile nobody re-reads. Two packages, named on one line,
# added into the pinned image at run time, with the surface re-asserted
# afterwards: tests/factory-root-gate/gate.sh does the same thing for the same
# reason. It costs a network fetch per run, which is stated here rather than
# discovered: this gate does not run offline.
#
# WHY A CLONE. Section 4 used one and the reason is not ceremony. This
# repository's working tree carries _out/ -- a rootfs, a package pool, compiled
# binaries, an apid UI bundle -- every byte of it produced by whatever the host
# had. A gate that mounted the working tree would be reading a machine's
# leftovers and calling them a criterion. It clones HEAD instead, so what is
# under test is what is committed.
