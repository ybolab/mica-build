#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/bare-host-gate/gate.sh runs this inside the pinned IMAGE_DOCKER_CLI_28
# plus `apk add bash make`; it IS the constrained host, so every command below
# is a host command by construction. No `# mos-build-side: container` marker for
# the reason substrate.sh states: nothing here is a producer, and declaring a
# file elides it from the lint's scan rather than exempting anything.
#
# RUNGS 1-3 of PLAN-080 section 4.2's ladder, re-climbed on demand.
#
# THE CEILING, and it is below section 4's. This climbs:
#
#   rung 1  bash docs/verify-index.sh              -- bash alone runs a gate
#   rung 2  make docs-verify                       -- make alone runs five
#           make os-host-toolchain-lint            -- and the policy's own check
#   rung 3  make os-layout-lint                    -- bun, out of a container
#           make os-verify-test                    -- 1270 tests, no host bun
#
# It does NOT climb rung 4 -- `bash build/run.sh --components image --board x64 [explicit component inputs]` and then
# `bash verify/run.sh --verify --board x64`, which section 4 ran by hand to
# `PASS (313/313)`. Assembling an image needs the amd64 package pool and a
# composed rootfs; a fresh clone has neither and making them costs tens of
# minutes. PLAN-080 section 10 predicted exactly this when it sized B6: it
# "needs a pool or a cached rootfs to be worth running". A cheap gate that runs
# beats an exhaustive one somebody turns off, so the ceiling is here and the
# rungs above it are named rather than implied.
#
# WHAT THE LOWER CEILING STOPS COVERING -- the part that must not be left to be
# discovered:
#
#   - Every host tool reachable only from the assembly path. rootfs/build.sh,
#     build/src/toolbox.ts's toolsets, pkgs/*/build.sh, build-env/deb/*, the
#     board bsp Makefiles: nothing here EXECUTES any of them.
#   - `bash build/run.sh --build-rootfs`. Section 4.4 measured it refusing on
#     the container route for want of one COPY of the buildx plugin into
#     verify/Dockerfile; RFCT-347 landed that COPY, so the refusal is gone and
#     the mode composes there -- an x64 root, then an image, then
#     `verify --verify` at 315/315, all with bun out of the pinned image. What
#     stops THIS gate climbing to it is unchanged and is the pool, not the
#     plugin: a `--depth 1` clone inside the CLI image has no _out/debs, and
#     building one is the tens of minutes the ceiling exists to avoid.
#   - `make os-build-test`, the first rung above this ceiling and the one worth
#     adding next: it opens the assemblers' toolboxes for real, which is the
#     closest thing to rung 4 that needs no pool. Section 8 measured two of its
#     files alone at ~118 s, so it is affordable but not free, and it is left
#     out rather than added without the run that prices the whole suite.
#
# The half of that gap which can be closed WITHOUT executing anything is closed
# at rung 2, and that is the reason the lint runs in here rather than only on
# the host: tests/host-toolchain-lint.sh reads every tracked script, including
# all the ones this ladder never runs, so a producer that starts reaching for a
# host tool inside rootfs/build.sh is still a finding. What neither half sees is
# section 6's own stated residue -- a binary behind a variable, a heredoc body,
# and a `# mos-build-side: container` declaration that is simply wrong.

# Naming what broke.
#
# "The build failed on a bare host" is a dated observation with the date taken
# off. What a reader needs is the tool and the file, so a rung that goes red
# reads as a finding about ONE invocation instead of a report that something,
# somewhere, needs something.
#
# Four signatures, all of them measured in this image on 2026-09-05 rather than
# recalled:
#
#   bash        /tmp/b.sh: line 3: nosuchtool: command not found   <- file AND line
#   busybox sh  /tmp/s.sh: line 2: nosuchtool: not found
#               /bin/sh: nosuchtool: not found
#   make        make: nosuchtool: No such file or directory
#   this tree   error: <tool> is required and not on PATH          <- ten scripts
#
# The first two carry the file themselves. The last two do not, so every tool is
# ALSO located by a command-position grep over the tracked surface -- the same
# match shape tests/host-toolchain-lint.sh uses, which is why a hit here reads
# the way a hit there does.
#
# AND THE TRANSCRIPT IS READ ON THE GREEN PATH TOO, which is not symmetry for
# its own sake. Measured 2026-09-05, by planting `jq -r .version package.json`
# into docs/verify-index.sh above its `set -euo pipefail`: busybox printed
# `docs/verify-index.sh: line 30: jq: not found`, the script carried on, the
# rung exited 0 and the gate reported PASS. A gate that watched only exit codes
# would have called a new host dependency green -- so a tool named in the output
# of a rung that SUCCEEDED is a finding as well, and it says which of the two
# shapes it is.
