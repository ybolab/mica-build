#   bash /root/cx3576-bench-collect.sh report
#
# The procedure this implements is docs/boards/cx3576-bench.md. It runs ON THE
# DEVICE, over the serial console, one stage at a time, and its output is a
# markdown report with docs/boards/cx3576.md's legacy Qualification
# results rows plus the live matrix's 39 current details.
#
# IT NEEDS NOTHING FROM THE REPOSITORY. It is copied to the device and run
# there. Everything it needs is in this file or on the image.
#
# WHAT IS ON THE IMAGE, measured on a shipped root: bash, sh, curl, networkctl,
# journalctl, systemctl, mos-deploy, podman, udevadm, dmesg, lsblk, date, stat, awk,
# sed, grep. ABSENT: jq, python3, wget, perl -- and there is no package
# manager, which is a property under test rather than an obstacle. BusyBox
# ships with no applet links by design. So: no `jq`, nothing is installed, and
# every probe outside the list above is guarded by `command -v` and RECORDS ITS
# ABSENCE rather than skipping.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IT MUST NOT REPORT A PASS IT DID NOT OBSERVE. This is the whole design
# constraint and it shapes three things:
#
#   1. `record` accepts exactly pass | fail | N/A | not tested, and pass/fail
#      carry an ISO date -- the same grammar tools/docs/verify-board.sh enforces
#      on the dossier. There is no code path that writes `pass` from anything
#      but a probe that returned green or an operator who said so.
#   2. Human steps PROMPT, WAIT and RECORD WHAT THE OPERATOR SAW. With no
#      terminal on stdin they record `not tested -- no operator present`. An
#      unattended run that silently skipped them would produce a report that
#      looks complete, which is the failure mode this file exists to prevent.
#   3. A row that was not reached at all is `not tested` NAMING THE STAGE that
#      produces it. Off-hardware gates that back a row are noted as evidence
#      about their own surface, never as a hardware pass.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NO `set -e`, DELIBERATELY. This is a collector: probes are EXPECTED to fail
# -- an absent tool, an unbound driver, a file the kernel did not create -- and
# each of those failures is a result to be recorded. Under `set -e` the first
# one would abort the run, losing every row after it and producing a partial
# report with no explanation. Exit status is captured explicitly at each call
# site instead. `set -u` and `set -o pipefail` stay: an unset variable here is
# a typo in a probe name, and a pipeline whose producer died is not a reading.
