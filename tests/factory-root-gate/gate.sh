#   bash tests/factory-root-gate/gate.sh _out/x64
#
# `make os-factory-root-gate` runs this, and so does the deep lane in
# .github/workflows/privileged.yml -- the only place it can run on cx3576. The
# invariant it checks is the one every smoke-run result rests on, and nothing
# else checks it. README.md here carries the reasoning in full.
#
# It runs in a container because neither side of the comparison is readable on
# the build host: there is no unsquashfs and no getcap. verify/src/tools.ts
# answers the same problem the same way, and this uses ITS image key and ITS
# package list, so a difference here cannot be a difference between two versions
# of squashfs-tools.
#
# It always runs mutate.sh, because a comparison nobody has watched fail is not
# a check: the capability comparison in particular has nothing behind it on a
# root that carries no file capabilities, where it compares an empty file with
# an empty file and reports agreement. Proving each comparison can fail is part
# of the gate.
