#
#   bash mutate.sh <work-dir>
#
# A comparison that has only ever been seen agreeing is not a check, and this
# campaign has found six or more passes of exactly that kind in code that had
# been green for months. Each mutation below is applied to the OCI side ALONE,
# the comparison it targets is re-run and required to go red, the mutation is
# reverted, and the comparison is re-run and required to go silent -- so a pass
# here means the check fired AND that it is not now permanently red.
#
# THE CAPABILITY CASE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST. This root carries ZERO file
# capabilities, so inner.sh's caps comparison compares an empty file with an
# empty file and prints agreement. Without the mutation below, that line says
# "nothing looked" while reading as "no capability was lost". The arm64 roots
# put the hardlink comparison in the same position -- neither cx3576 nor
# virt-arm64 carries a single multiply-linked file -- which is why case 9 has
# two forms and says which one it used.
#
# gate.sh always runs this. It is not an optional second pass.
