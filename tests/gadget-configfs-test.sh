#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Offline contract tests for boards/cx3576/hwinit/hwinit-gadget, the script
# that builds the CDC ACM debug console gadget in configfs.
#
# WHAT THIS MODELS, AND WHY THE MODEL IS THE TEST. configfs does not store a
# symlink and resolve it on use. `configfs_symlink()` resolves the target
# STRING at creation time with `kern_path()` -- fs/configfs/symlink.c
# `get_target()` -- and `kern_path()` resolves a relative path against the
# CALLING PROCESS's working directory, not against the directory the link is
# created in. A temporary directory cannot reproduce that: on any ordinary
# filesystem `../../functions/acm.usb0` from `configs/c.1/` resolves correctly
# no matter where the process stands, which is exactly why the defect survived
# review. So case 1 asserts the PROPERTY configfs applies -- the target string
# must name the function directory when resolved from the process's own cwd --
# rather than asserting that a link exists, which the broken script also
# satisfied.
#
# The defect this closes, measured on hardware 2026-09-08 (RFCT-355): the
# service runs from `/` (Type=oneshot, no WorkingDirectory=), the relative
# target resolved as `/functions/acm.usb0`, symlink(2) returned ENOENT,
# `2>/dev/null || true` swallowed it, and the empty configuration was handed to
# the UDC:
#
#   Config c/1 of cx3576_serial needs at least one function.
#   udc 23000000.usb: failed to start cx3576_serial: -22
