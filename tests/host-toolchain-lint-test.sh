#     false positive spends some of what makes a rule worth reading.
#
#     The second half is what the first must not cost. The distinction is
#     COMMAND SUBSTITUTION versus LITERAL PAREN, not quoted versus unquoted:
#     `"$(cargo build)"` compiles on this host and stays a finding. Without this
#     case the cheapest way to pass the first half is to drop every quoted span,
