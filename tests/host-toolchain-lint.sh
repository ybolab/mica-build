#!/usr/bin/env bash
# No toolchain on the host. No compilation on the host. No assembly on the host.
#
# The policy is docs/design/build.md section 0, and this is what makes it fail.
# It exists because that page has carried the claim -- "no toolchain is
# installed on the host, and every compiler comes out of a builder image pinned
# by digest" -- for as long as it has existed, while paths that contradict it
# sat in the tree with nothing going red.
#
# WHAT IT LOOKS FOR. Three shapes over two surfaces. In shell: one producer
# binary in command position, in a file that has not declared itself
# container-side -- and one PATH assignment that prepends a directory under
# $HOME, which is how a script reaches for a toolchain that is not on the
# machine's PATH at all. In TypeScript: one producer binary NAMED by a process
# launch -- a bun shell template or an argv-taking spawn -- which is the shape
# `build/run.sh` and `verify/run.sh` would take if a fifth toolbox seam were
# written past the four that are closed. The second shape exists
# because the first one nearly missed the largest violation in the tree: this
# host has no cargo, and `pkgs/mosd/hack/check.sh` finds one only because its
# line 8 puts $HOME/.cargo/bin in front. A producer is a tool whose own build can
# change the bytes it writes: a compiler, a filesystem maker, an image
# assembler, a packer, a signer. docs/design/build.md section 0 states the test
# that decides whether a new tool belongs in the table below; this file is the
# table, not the rule.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, said here rather than discovered later:
#
#   - A binary invoked through a VARIABLE. `"${MKIMAGE}" -T script` is a real
#     mkimage call and nothing here matches it; tests/handshake-test/harness.sh
#     line 101 is exactly that shape, and it is covered only because the file
#     declares its side. A grep cannot resolve a variable, and pretending
#     otherwise would be worse than saying so.
#   - A HEREDOC BODY. Bodies are skipped whole. (A comment that merely MENTIONS
#     one does not open it: comments are looked at first, or a `# ... <<EOF` in
#     prose would elide the rest of the file and still report it clean.) Every heredoc in this tree that
#     carries a producer today carries a CONTAINER script -- `docker run ...
#     <<'INNER'`, or a `cat > inner.sh` whose output is run in one -- so the
#     elision costs nothing measured; a host build step written into one would
#     not be seen.
#   - A DECLARATION THAT IS WRONG. `# mos-build-side: container` is a claim by
#     whoever wrote it. This counts the claims and refuses a run that found
#     none; it cannot check one.
#   - A TYPESCRIPT LAUNCH THROUGH A VARIABLE. The second scan below reads every
#     tracked `.ts` file, but it can only report the command a call site NAMES:
#     `$`${docker} exec ...`` and `Bun.spawn(argv)` resolve at runtime, and 16
#     of this tree's 35 launch sites are that shape. They are counted and
#     reported as unresolved rather than passed over silently.
#   - A TYPESCRIPT `mos-build-side:` MARKER. There is none, deliberately: every
#     producer this tree's TypeScript runs goes through `docker`, so no `.ts`
#     file is itself a container's script, and a marker grammar nothing uses is
#     a grammar nobody maintains. A TypeScript finding that must stand is
#     registered in the exemption file like any other.
#
# DECLARING A SIDE. Two markers, both requiring a reason after `--`:
#
#   # mos-build-side: container -- <why>          the whole FILE runs in an image;
#                                                 must appear before any code
#   # mos-build-side: container-block -- <why>    the lines BELOW run in an image
#   # mos-build-side: host                        ...and here they stop
#
# EXEMPTIONS live in tests/host-toolchain-exemptions, one `path<TAB>tool<TAB>reason`
# per site, and an exemption that matches NOTHING is a failure -- a rename must
# not leave a rule behind about a file that has moved, and a path that stops
# violating the policy must not keep a silent waiver.

# THE TABLE, by kind, with the reason each kind is in it. It is not the policy
# -- docs/design/build.md section 0 is -- but a reader adding a row should be
# able to see which arm of that test the row belongs to.
#
#   toolchain   a compiler decides the bytes even when the binary is discarded:
#               `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` turns a toolchain difference into
#               red or green, and docs/design/build-harness.md section 3 has the
#               measurement (a 1.96 rustc ahead of the image's 1.98 reported
#               `can't find crate for std` against a workspace that was fine).
#   filesystem  which e2fsprogs, which mkfs.vfat. This host's mkfs.vfat is
#               BusyBox's and does not know `--invariant`.
#   assembly    which sgdisk, which grub-efi-amd64-bin. BOOTX64.EFI is only as
#               reproducible as the package in its container.
#   package     which dpkg, which rauc. A bundle built by rauc 1.8 was refused
#               by a device's 1.13; commit 9a43a59 records it.
#   signing     what openssl writes into a certificate is openssl's decision.
#
# NOT in the table, deliberately: `cc`, `ld`, `go`, `make`, `tar`, `install`.
# Each is either a word that appears constantly in prose and in paths, or
# orchestration by the section-0 test. A rule whose findings are mostly false
# positives teaches people to ignore it, which is worse than no rule --
# tests/shell-pipefail-lint.sh states the same principle for the same reason.
#
# `jq` IS THE AWKWARD ONE, and it is left out with its exception named rather
# than quietly. It is orchestration nearly everywhere here -- reading a field,
# building a fixture -- but pkgs/rauc/gen-dev-keys.sh edits
# meta/updates/manifest.json with it, and that file reaches the image. A row
# for `jq` would flag tests/release-verify-test.sh's fixture edits too, which
# are verdicts, and the table cannot tell the two apart from the binary's name.
# So the one producing use travels with that script's existing openssl
# exemption and its backlog item, which is where it will actually be fixed.
