# Offline contract tests for boards/cx3576/hwinit/hwinit-mac, the script that
# gives this board's Ethernet ports a stable MAC address.
#
# THE PROPERTY IS STABILITY UNDER RENAMING, and it is the property because the
# names are not stable. This board boots net.ifnames=0, so `eth0` and `eth1` are
# the order the two NICs registered in and nothing else; on the first hardware
# boot (2026-09-08) the on-board GMAC registered at 11.6657 s and the RTL8168
# behind PCIe at 11.6711 s, four and a half milliseconds apart. So the same
# silicon at the same place on the board must get the same address whether it is
# called eth0 or eth1, and two ports must never be given one address.
#
# It is DRIVEN FROM THE FAILING SIDE, and the failing side is produced from the
# shipped script rather than transcribed beside it: case 2 rewrites the one
# expression that changed -- the md5 input -- back to the interface name, which
# is what this file used to hash, and requires the swapped fixture to come out
# with the two addresses exchanged. A hand-written copy of the old derivation
# would only test the copy.
#
# WHAT THE FIXTURE MODELS. /sys/class/net/<iface> is a symlink into
# /sys/devices, and the `device` entry inside it is a second symlink up to the
# port's own device. Both are reproduced, because the derivation is exactly the
# path that pair resolves to -- `platform/2a220000.ethernet` for the GMAC,
# `platform/22000000.pcie/…/0000:01:00.0` for the PCIe part -- and a fixture
# that stored the string instead would be asserting against its own answer.
# MOS_MAC_SYSFS and MOS_MAC_CONF exist for this and are unset on a device;
# ip(8) is a stub on PATH, so the real script's real command line is what is
# read back.
