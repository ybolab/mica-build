# binary in pkgs/podman/out-arm64, under emulation, the one the device runs.

# The marker is an HTML comment, `<!-- quadlet: NAME -->`, immediately before
# the fenced block. Invisible when the document is rendered, unambiguous to
# parse, and it names the file the block is, because Quadlet's behaviour
# depends on the extension: a `.network` and a `.container` holding identical
