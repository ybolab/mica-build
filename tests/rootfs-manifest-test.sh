#!/usr/bin/env bash
# rootfs/packages/resolve.sh, driven over the boards, profiles, radios and
# features this repository actually supports.
#
# Three things are asserted and the third is the one that is easy to skip:
#
#   1. THE RESOLVED SETS, for both boards at both profiles, and for a build that
#      declines every feature. Written out literally: a test that recomputed the
#      answer from the manifests would agree with any manifest at all.
#   2. EVERY REFUSAL, each proven RED BY MUTATION. A copy of the manifest tree
#      is made under tmp/, perturbed there, and the refusal is required to fire
#      on the copy and NOT on the pristine one -- a negative test whose removal
#      changes nothing is not a test. Each is matched on a FRAGMENT of its
#      message and not on the exit status alone, because a perturbed tree is
#      usually true of more than one refusal at once; and every fragment is then
#      required to be absent from all the other refusals' messages, so a
#      fragment that stopped discriminating fails here rather than silently
#      accepting whichever refusal happened to fire.
#   3. THE REVERSE DIRECTION: every package every producer declares has to be
#      reachable by SOME legal resolution. A package no manifest can ever name
#      is a package the composer will never install, and nothing else in this
#      repository would notice -- every check downstream of composition runs
#      over the set that WAS installed. Both counts are printed and a zero on
#      either side fails.
#
# No docker, no build, no pool: this reads manifests and runs producers.sh.
