# ENTRY SCRIPT -- the artefact half of proof 4: the board's own U-Boot control
# FDT takes a required FIT signing key.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES. That `mkimage -K u-boot.dtb -r` over the control FDT the
# cx3576 U-Boot build produces writes `/signature/key-mosdev` with
# `required = "conf"` and `algo = sha256,rsa2048`, and by how much the DTB
# grows. Together with fit-sandbox.sh this is "the board's U-Boot could be
# given an anchor, and a U-Boot with one refuses what it should" -- the two
# halves that can be measured without the hardware. What remains untested is
# repacking `u-boot-rockchip.bin` around the modified control FDT and booting
# it, which needs the board.
#
# ON WHICH TARGET. The cx3576 U-Boot artefact of this checkout; mkimage comes
# from the sandbox image, built at the same upstream commit as the board's.
#
#   bash tests/signed-boot-lab/cx3576-control-fdt.sh --dtb <u-boot.dtb>
#
# The board build does not export u-boot.dtb today; take it out of the build
# stage, e.g. with a `--target` build that copies /uboot/u-boot.dtb, or from a
# board tree that has one.
