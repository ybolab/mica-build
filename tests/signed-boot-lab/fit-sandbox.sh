# ENTRY SCRIPT -- proof 4 of the plan's P1 row: what a required-signature FIT
# configuration buys, and what it refuses.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES. That U-Boot, with a public key in its control FDT marked
# `required = "conf"`, boots a FIT whose configuration signature verifies and
# refuses every other shape: a FIT with no signature at all, a FIT signed by a
# key the control FDT does not carry, and a FIT whose kernel, DTB or initramfs
# has one bit changed after signing -- each refused with U-Boot's own message,
# and the boot stops rather than continuing with the payload.
#
# ON WHICH TARGET. The U-Boot SANDBOX, built from the same upstream commit
# boards/cx3576/bsp/uboot/Dockerfile builds for the board, so the verification
# code under test is the code that ships. It is not the board: cx3576 silicon
# is not here and QEMU has no rk3576 machine, so what this proves is the
# behaviour of that U-Boot's FIT verifier, not a boot on the device.
# tests/signed-boot-lab/cx3576-control-fdt.sh covers the other half -- that the
# board's own control FDT takes the key.
