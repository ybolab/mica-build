# ENTRY SCRIPT -- proofs 1, 2 and 3 of the file-based A/B plan's P1 row, on one
# kernel.
#
# WHAT IT PROVES. That the kernel under test authenticates a dm-verity root
# hash before it maps a root: a valid detached PKCS#7 signature is accepted and
# the root mounts; an absent one, one by a key the kernel does not trust, one
# with a byte changed, one cut short, and a valid signature over a DIFFERENT
# root's hash are each refused, with the kernel's own errno as the verdict; a
# block modified under an otherwise valid signature is served as EIO while its
# neighbours still read; and the same kernel accepts a SECOND signed root,
# which is the property that decouples rootfs releases from kernel rebuilds.
# Every mapping is created through `veritysetup --root-hash-signature` over a
# read-only loop device with explicit geometry, which is proof 3.
#
# ON WHICH TARGET. Whichever kernel is named: the x64 or virt-arm64 mainline
# build, or the cx3576 vendor build. It boots that kernel in QEMU with the two
# roots inside an initramfs, so it needs no disk, no board and no bootloader.
#
#   A_SRC=_out/x64 B_SRC=_out/second-root \
#     bash tests/signed-boot-lab/verity-matrix.sh \
#       --arch amd64 --kernel _out/boards/x64/kernel/bzImage
#
# Options: --arch amd64|arm64, --kernel <file>, --append "<extra cmdline>",
# --tag <prefix for the log names>. The cx3576 kernel needs
# `--append initcall_blacklist=rockchip_drm_init`; see the README.
