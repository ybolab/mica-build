# The container engine is built and released by ybolab/mica-podman; this
# repository imports the archives through deps/packages/mica-podman.json and
# never sees that repository's tree. Four of its consumers still need two
# things out of it: the versions the seven binaries were built from (the
# smoke register, the install-closure gate and the netavark kernel check
# compare what a binary reports against them) and the aarch64 quadlet
# binary (tests/quadlet-doc-test.sh runs the generator the image ships).
# The package carries the first as /usr/share/mica-podman/versions.env.
#
# THE VERSIONS FILE IS COMMITTED BESIDE THE PIN, not read out of the pool at
# test time, so that every offline suite has it and a checkout without a
# pool still says what the engine's versions are. It is a derived file:
# --refresh rewrites it from the archives after a lock bump, and --check --
# run by `make os-pool` -- refuses a copy that disagrees with what the two
# archives at the pin carry, so the copy cannot drift from the pin.
