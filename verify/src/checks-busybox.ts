// The emergency BusyBox binary (RFCT-281/PLAN-045), and the four things it must
// NOT have become.
//
// The image gains one file, /usr/bin/busybox, and an operator reaches an applet
// by naming it: `busybox sh`, `busybox ls`. Everything else about this package
// is a negative -- no applet link, no PATH entry, no /build/bin, no initramfs
// role, no init role, no GNU command quietly re-pointed at it -- and a negative
// is exactly the shape of assertion that passes by finding nothing.
//
// SO EVERY CHECK HERE REPORTS THE SIZE OF THE SPACE IT SEARCHED, and refuses
// when that space is empty. `packedRoot` already refuses an unpacked tree with
// no entries in it, which is the coarse version of the same guard; these are the
// per-check ones. `packed-busybox-unexpanded` fails outright when the binary is
// absent rather than reporting "nothing links to it", because with no binary in
// the root there is nothing an applet link could point at and the conclusion
// would be true of every image ever built, including one that ships no busybox
// at all. checks-busybox.test.ts drives each of them red from a fixture that is
// green first.
//
// The counterpart assertions are elsewhere and are deliberately not repeated
// here: the PRODUCER (mica-system:busybox/Dockerfile) asserts its staged
// payload is exactly two files with no link of any kind, which is the stronger
// statement because no applet link can reach an image without passing through
// it; and rootfs/scripts/pack-export-boot.sh asserts the EXPORTED initramfs
// carries no busybox, which is the one question a packed root cannot answer
// because the initrd is on the ESP and outside it.
//
// No matcher here is a substring of another batch's conclusion: every one of
// them names BusyBox, and this is the only family in the register that mentions
// it.
