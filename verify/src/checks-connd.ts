// Batch 4a: the connd contract, the Wi-Fi userland, and micad's networkd namespace.
//
// Twenty-two conclusions on cx3576 and four on x64: one contract read,
// nineteen assertions it feeds (all of them behind
// `board_has_radio wifi`), and the two namespace conclusions that run on every
// board.
//
// Every path, prefix and unit name the Wi-Fi assertions compare against is read
// out of `micad:micad/src/reconciler/` -- the pinned micad source, checked out
// by `tools/micad-pool.sh --source` into _out/src/mica-core -- rather than restated here, exactly as the
// oracle reads it. Reading those sources is in scope under the Scope
// section -- "No change to ... `micad/` Rust sources" -- while changing them is
// not, and nothing here writes. A reconciler that renders into a directory the
// image does not provide, or drives a unit the image does not install, fails on
// the device and nowhere else.
//
// The extractor itself rotted once, which is why there is no fallback. The
// oracle records it: the sweep marker was read with a regex over
// `file_name.contains("...")`, network.rs was refactored to an anchored
// `is_mos_managed()`, the regex stopped matching and the marker became "". The
// collision test `case "${n}" in *"${MICA_SWEEP}"*)` then became `**` and matched
// every filename, and the nineteen assertions fell back through
// `${STA_UNIT:-wpa_supplicant@.service}` and passed against the verifier's own
// restatement of a contract it had failed to read.
//
// So there is no `?? 'wpa_supplicant@.service'` anywhere here: an unread contract
// makes the group fail rather than substitute, the sweep is a prefix matched with
// an anchor, and the `.network` suffix is asserted rather than assumed. The
// register matchers are generated at module load for the same reason, so when
// the read fails the generated matcher is the degenerate string the oracle
// prints and the two sides stay comparable.
