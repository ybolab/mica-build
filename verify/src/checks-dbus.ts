// The D-Bus policies: the system bus, mosd's local root-only management name,
// the absence of namespace-wide application grants, and bluez's policy.
//
// Eleven conclusions on each board, one of them a SKIP on x64. Everything here
// reads the unpacked root and nothing else.
//
// A policy parser and not a grep. A D-Bus rule routinely spans several source
// lines, so a line-oriented reader sees the bus name and the member on different
// lines and concludes the grant names no member -- the dangerous direction,
// because it turns a correctly scoped grant into a reported hazard whose obvious
// repair is to stop scoping it. So both of the oracle's readers are ported as readers:
// `stripComments` is `dbus_policy_rules_only`, an awk state machine over
// `<!--`/`-->` that spans lines and preserves line structure; `policyTags` is
// `dbus_policy_tags`, the same text reflowed to one XML tag per line,
// which is what makes a per-line scoped/member judgement sound; `policyFacts` is
// the awk , rules collected per <policy> block, because a rule's block
// decides who it applies to.
//
// The bus name is read, never written down. `com.mos.mosd` appears nowhere here
// as the name being checked: the oracle reads it out of mosd.service's
// `BusName=` so that a policy for a name nothing owns fails rather than
// sails through. Restating it would put the constant back in two places.
