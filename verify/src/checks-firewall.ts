// The base image's firewall TOOL (RFCT-296/PLAN-075) and the unit that must not
// run.
//
// mica-system depends on `nftables`, so every image carries it whatever it
// declines; `iptables` left the image (2026-09-13), nft is the one front-end.
// NO RULE, NO POLICY AND NOTHING THAT PERSISTS ONE is shipped with it, so
// nothing here reads a ruleset: the facts an image can be asked about are that
// the binary is reachable and that nftables.service is disabled by a decision
// rather than by an absence.
//
// WHY `packed-nft-present` IS NOT A DUPLICATE OF `container-engine-nft`, which
// also asserts nft is in the image. They are two independent statements that
// happen to share a binary, exactly as mica-podman and mica-system both declaring
// `nftables` are two statements rather than one. checks-engine.ts asks whether
// the CONTAINER ENGINE can run -- netavark execs nft by name and the first
// `podman run` fails without it -- and that check is the engine family's, board
// and profile scoped with it. This one asks whether the BASE IMAGE has its
// firewall vocabulary, which is now true of an image that declines containers
// and where the engine family has nothing to say. Deleting either because the
// other exists would leave a real hole; their matchers are disjoint on purpose
// and checks-firewall.test.ts asserts that.
//
// THE CHAIN IS FOLLOWED INSIDE THE ROOT, hop by hop, and that is not a nicety:
// a link's target may be image-absolute, so handing it to statSync would ask
// about the VERIFIER HOST's filesystem, and a packed root with a DANGLING link
// would then resolve against this machine. `script-commands.ts` re-roots the
// same walk for the same reason and says so; this module cannot reuse it
// because `resolvesInRoot` answers a boolean and the check has to name the
// chain it walked.
//
// THE SECOND CHECK IS ABOUT A UNIT NOBODY ENABLED, and its whole point is that
// "nobody enabled it" is not the same fact as "it is disabled". The nftables
// package ships nftables.service, whose ExecStart is `nft -f
// /etc/nftables.conf`, and the config it ships begins with `flush ruleset` --
// so an enabled unit clears netavark's container-network rules at every boot.
// Before mica-system shipped 50-mos-nftables.preset, NO preset in the image
// matched that unit, and the unmatched fallback is ENABLE: measured in a clean
// trixie root, `systemctl preset nftables.service` with the stock set creates
// sysinit.target.wants/nftables.service. So the check asserts the preset
// RESOLUTION and not only the absence of a link -- a root with no link and no
// rule is one `systemctl preset-all` away from the failure, and a check that
// only counted links would call it correct.
