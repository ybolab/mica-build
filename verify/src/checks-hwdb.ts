// PLAN-086 S4: the static hardware database, asserted GONE -- and the udev
// rules it was removed from, asserted intact.
//
// The image ships udev, its rules, its runtime device state and the kernel
// module indexes. What it must not ship is the 22.9 MB static hardware database
// -- /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.bin, /etc/udev/hwdb.bin and the .hwdb sources under
// /usr/lib/udev/hwdb.d and /etc/udev/hwdb.d -- nor the machinery that rebuilds
// it, nor a rule that queries it.
//
// EVERY CHECK HERE IS A NEGATIVE, which is the shape of assertion that passes by
// finding nothing, so every one of them reports the size of the space it
// searched and refuses when that space is empty. A root with no udev in it at
// all satisfies "no hwdb ships" trivially and is not the fact anyone wants
// asserted; `packedRoot` refuses an empty unpack, and these are the per-check
// guards under it.
//
// THE FOURTH CHECK IS THE ONE THAT COULD NOT BE WRITTEN AS A NEGATIVE. Removing
// a query clause means editing a rule that usually does something else on the
// same line, and the failure mode of a token-level edit is taking a whole rule
// with it. The plan names the four categories that must survive -- permissions,
// symlinks, module loading and service activation -- and this asserts one
// concrete action per category, in the file that carries it, on the shipped
// image. rootfs/scripts/hwdb-remove.sh asserts a survivor table of its own at
// BUILD time and fails the build; this one reads the packed root and is
// deliberately an INDEPENDENT transcription, because a check that imported the
// build script's table would move with it and agree with itself.
//
// WHAT THIS FAMILY CANNOT SEE is whether those rules FIRE. A rule file that
// still holds `GROUP="tty"` is not the same claim as a booted system whose
// /dev/tty is group tty. That claim needs a running kernel and is recorded in
// docs/task/RFCT-346.md against a booted guest; this is the static half.
//
// No matcher here is a substring of another's, and every one of the eight
// mentions hwdb, which no other conclusion in the register does.
