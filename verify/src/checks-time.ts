// The time contract of PLAN-044: the composed root carries systemd-timesyncd,
// enabled, under the pinned base policy, and keeps its default timezone UTC.
//
// Four checks, four different failures. The package can be absent while the
// drop-in ships (a manifest edit lost the package), the drop-in can drift while
// the package installs (someone "tuned" a value that is base policy, not a
// setting), the enablement symlink can be lost without either (a payload edit),
// and a timezone can reach /etc while all three hold (machine time must stay
// UTC; the timezone is presentation, owned by the settings surface, and never
// this file's).
//
// The policy values are TRANSCRIBED from the shipped drop-in rather than read
// out of it, for checks-fixture.ts's ORACLE_BUILTIN_MARKUP reason: a check
// seeded from the very file it asserts would move with that file and stay
// green. These four numbers are PLAN-044's, fixed by decision on 2026-08-31,
// and an image disagreeing with them is the failure whichever side was edited.
