// The command names a shell script invokes at command position, and whether
// each resolves inside the packed root.
//
// A transcription of `mos_script_commands` and `sq_resolves_cmd`, in their own
// module because they are a nine-stage text pipeline that would bury the check
// using them.
//
// A pipeline and not a shell parser, because that is what the oracle is and the
// port has to agree with it including where it is wrong: a real parser would
// find commands this misses and miss commands this finds, and every difference
// would be a divergence attributable to the port rather than to the image. The
// extractor is deliberately conservative and the oracle says so -- commands the
// scripts invoke through their own `run`/`have` wrappers (busctl, rauc,
// systemctl, curl, wget) are not in this set and must not be, because
// `mos-health` uses `have X ||` to mark curl and wget optional.
//
// `sq_resolves_cmd` was, for a while, the only path test here that resolved a
// symlink INSIDE the image; everywhere else `[ -f ]` and `stat` followed a link
// the way the shell does, which inside a container means the container's root.
// RFCT-358 made in-root resolution the rule rather than this function's private
// exception, so the hand-rolled chase is gone and `regularFileInRoot` is what
// judges a candidate -- the same walk, at the kernel's own ELOOP ceiling rather
// than the oracle's eight hops, and with the intermediate DIRECTORY components
// resolved too, which the chase never did.
