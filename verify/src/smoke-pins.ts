// Where a self-built artifact's recorded version is read from, and nothing else.
//
// The version loop is closed here -- bumping a `versions.env` pin without
// rebuilding the artifact turns the smoke run red -- and a loop is only closed
// if the two ends are the same file. So every function reads a pin out of the
// file that owns it, at run time, and there is deliberately no literal version
// string anywhere in verify/.
//
// The second list is the failure mode this file exists to avoid: `TOOL_PACKAGES`
// pinned from a copy of an `apk add` line, a hardcoded hwinit list that drifted
// and cost the image its stable MAC, a `SHIPPED_BOARDS = ['cx3576', 'x64']`
// literal that made a third board invisible to a lint reporting 26/26 PASS.
// Every one was green while being wrong, because a copy agrees with itself.
//
// No parser is written here either. `versions.env` is `KEY=value` with comments,
// exactly what `board-env.ts` already reads as data rather than by sourcing it,
// and that parser refuses command substitution, backticks, parameter expansion
// and unquoted metacharacters by name. A second `sed -n 's/^KEY=//p'` would be a
// second set of semantics for one file format, agreeing right up until a value
// acquired a quote.
