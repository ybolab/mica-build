// The runner, driven from the failing side without a daemon, an image or a build.
//
// Everything here is reachable because the
// runner takes an `Exec` -- a function from argv to (status, stdout, stderr) --
// so the suite fabricates outcomes a healthy tree can never produce: a
// wrong-architecture refusal, a binary that is not where the register says, a
// version that does not match its pin. A harness that could only be exercised
// against a correct image would have no way to show that its RED branches work,
// and a check whose red branch has never run is a check nobody has run.
//
// The version loop is tested as a loop, not as a comparison: bumping a
// `versions.env` pin without rebuilding the artifact must turn the smoke run
// red, and the case below does exactly that -- one fixture file, one unchanged
// binary output, one edit to the pin, and the verdict flips. Asserting `judge`
// on two literals would test the comparison and say nothing about whether the
// pin is re-read from the file it lives in.
