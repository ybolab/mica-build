// How systemd would resolve a unit's enablement in a packed root: where its
// unit file may live, what the shipped presets say about it, and which `.wants`
// or `.requires` links name it.
//
// ONE IMPLEMENTATION, IMPORTED TWICE. This began as private helpers inside
// `checks-firewall.ts` for `nftables.service`, and `checks-display.ts` needs
// exactly the same predicate for `getty@tty1.service`. A second copy would be
// two readers of one systemd rule, free to disagree about masking or ordering
// while both stayed green -- and the rule they encode is subtle enough that the
// disagreement would not be obvious. So it moved here whole rather than being
// re-transcribed.
//
// THE SUBTLETY, and it is why none of this can be a grep. Preset files mask by
// BASENAME across /etc, /run and /usr/lib; the merged set is then read in
// lexicographic order of that basename; and the FIRST rule matching the unit
// wins. A `grep -q 'disable getty@.service'` finds the line it is looking for
// on an image where an `enable getty@*` in an earlier-sorting file has already
// decided the question the other way.
